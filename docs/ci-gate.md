# CI regression gate

The gate fails a pull request when an edit introduces one of these structural regressions:

- a **new dependency cycle**
- a **new duplication finding**
- an **existing non-exported symbol that becomes an orphan with no mapped callers**

Exported symbols are exempt from the pull-request gate. The edit simulation and post-edit hook
also flag exported symbols as `check: call-caller-preflight`. The gate runs the same verdict as
`scripts/diff.mjs` on each pull request.

These checks cover the mapped graph, not all runtime
dependencies. Diff responses report `analysis.checks`: a skipped check is not a
pass. Refresh drops overlap evidence and leaves duplication unevaluated; a full pipeline
rebuild includes overlap analysis. Structural green does not establish behavioral correctness.

Known unsupported same-line JS/TS declarations make the gate inconclusive (exit 2).
The comment names diagnostic source locations instead of reporting a clean result.
Both snapshots matter: repair does not make an incomplete baseline trustworthy.

## Add it to your repo

`.github/workflows/codeweb-gate.yml`:

```yaml
name: codeweb gate
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write            # only needed for `comment: true` below
jobs:
  gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0          # required — the gate diffs against the PR base sha
      - uses: GhostlyGawd/codeweb/.github/actions/codeweb-gate@v0.16.0
        with:
          target: src             # subdirectory to analyze (default: .)
          codeweb-ref: v0.16.0    # pin the engine too — see below
          comment: true           # post the structural review as a sticky PR comment
          history: true           # keep a cross-PR trend line in the comment (Actions cache)
```

`fetch-depth: 0` is **required**: the gate materializes the PR base commit to build the "before"
graph, so the full history must be present.

**Pin the action to a release tag** (`@v0.14.0`-style, as above), not `@main` — a moving ref can
change your gate's verdict semantics under you. Pin the engine as well: `codeweb-ref` accepts a
branch, tag, or commit sha, and it defaults to `main` so the zero-config path keeps working.

Pin both to the same tag. The Action ref selects the workflow steps; `codeweb-ref` selects the
engine those steps clone and run. Left unpinned, either one can move under a green build.

**Monorepos:** the gate analyzes one `target` per invocation. Gate several packages with a
matrix — each package gets its own verdict, comment, and (with `history: true`) its own trend:

```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [packages/api, packages/web]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { fetch-depth: 0 }
      - uses: GhostlyGawd/codeweb/.github/actions/codeweb-gate@v0.16.0
        with:
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}
          codeweb-ref: v0.16.0
```

## The gate as a reviewer (`comment: true`)

With `comment: true`, the action posts a **structural review digest** and updates the same sticky
comment after each run. The digest shows changes to nodes, edges, names, cross-domain coupling,
cycles, and duplication findings.

The digest also identifies each blocker and gives the local reproduction command. Reviewers can
inspect the pull request's blast radius without installing codeweb.

Findings include source locations, bounded duplication evidence and confidence when available,
and investigation steps. With GitHub context, clean checkouts link to the checked-out commit and include
the configured target subdirectory. Dirty checkouts or a HEAD change during analysis fall back to
file-and-line locations, so a link cannot imply uncommitted code exists in that commit.

Local digests without GitHub context also use plain locations. Large finding
lists, cycle members, and duplication sites show explicit omitted counts.

The comment also states the analysis limits: a passing structural gate does not establish
behavioral correctness, and no mapped callers does not prove a symbol is unused. Check entry
points and dynamic dispatch before removing code, and run the relevant tests.

- Requires `permissions: pull-requests: write` in the calling workflow (shown above) and a
  `pull_request` event. Without either, the comment is skipped with a warning and the **check
  verdict still enforces** — fork PRs with a read-only token degrade gracefully.
- The comment posts **before** the verdict fails the job, so a blocking regression always
  arrives with its explanation.

## What it does

1. Builds the **after** graph from the PR head (the checked-out working tree).
2. Builds the **before** graph from the PR base — checked out read-only into an ephemeral git
   worktree, so your tree is never touched.
3. Runs the `diff` regression gate. **Exit 1** (PR fails) on a regression, **exit 0** otherwise.

Pure removals never trip the gate — deleting code, cycles, or duplication is an improvement. A
brand-new uncalled function is reported but does not fail the build (agents add functions before
wiring them).

## Run it locally

From the project directory, use the installed package:

```sh
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb gate --base origin/main --target src
```

`--base` is any git ref (a branch, tag, or sha) to compare the current working tree against.


A source checkout can run `node scripts/ci-gate.mjs` with the same options.
A passing gate means only that the named structural rules found no regression. It does not prove runtime correctness or complete analysis of dynamic calls.

## Start with report-only checks

Use report-only mode to inspect findings before you enable blocking:

```sh
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb gate --base origin/main --target src --report-only
```

The structural verdict and Markdown digest keep the regression finding. Only a completed regression changes from exit 1 to exit 0 in report-only mode.
Missing refs, failed graph builds, usage errors, and interrupted analysis still fail. Blocking remains the default.

For the Action, add `report-only: true` under `with:`. Use an Action ref and matching engine ref that contain this option; earlier releases do not support it.
The Action keeps the original gate exit code in its `verdict-code` output: 0 for clean, 1 for regression, and 2 for setup or analysis error.

## Check setup before the first query

Run these commands from your project directory:

```sh
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb setup --client cursor
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb .
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb doctor --client cursor --config .cursor/mcp.json --json
```

`setup` prints a recipe without writing configuration. Choose `claude`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `gemini`, or `codex`; merge the printed server entry into the named file and keep existing entries.
To remove the setup, remove only the `codeweb` server entry that you added.

`doctor` checks Node, the installed local MCP server, graph presence, and recorded source freshness. Its JSON lists named `pass`, `fail`, or `unknown` checks and an `ok` result.
Required failures or unverified freshness return exit 2. A successful local check returns exit 0; editor connection always remains unverified.

The optional `--client` and `--config` flags must be used together. Diagnostics inspect only that supplied file, never execute its command, and never print its values.
The Codex check supports the basic TOML recipe from `setup`. Other TOML forms can return `unknown`; this means the check cannot verify that syntax.

### Prove a caller query

Use a small source file, such as `src/example.js`:

```js
export function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
export function twice(x) { return add(x, x); }
```

Build its map with `npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb src --out-dir .codeweb`, then ask your connected agent to call `codeweb_callers` with `{"symbol":"add"}`.
The result must name `twice` as a caller. This query checks the editor connection and the map answer; the local doctor handshake alone cannot check the editor connection.
