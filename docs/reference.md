# codeweb reference

Every tool, output, and workflow — the full detail behind the [README](../README.md).
Bins, flags, environment variables, and exit codes are tabled separately in [`cli.md`](cli.md).

For reading paths and file ownership, start with the [documentation index](README.md).

Examples using `node scripts/...` run from a Codeweb source checkout; `<graph.json>`
is a placeholder for your target’s graph path. npm users can follow the
[runnable snapshot quickstart](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/start.html#npm-quickstart)
using shipped bins from their own repository.

## Outputs (under `<target>/.codeweb/`)

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `graph.json` | The machine-readable web: `nodes`, `edges`, `domains`, `overlaps`, plus `meta` (target root, engine, languages, stats). Schema versioning (BKL-L2, recorded design): the schema is deliberately unversioned and changes **additively only** — consumers must tolerate unknown fields; a `meta.schemaVersion` field ships with the first breaking change, not before (a version nobody checks is noise). |
| `report.html` | Self-contained interactive map — force-directed graph, domain tree, clickable node details, ranked overlap tab. No network/CDN required. |
| `report.md` | The same map as plain markdown — domains, top nodes, ranked overlaps. |
| `overlap.md` | The ranked consolidation opportunities in plain markdown. |
| `optimize.md` | The consolidation advisory — duplicate-logic findings tiered **ready / blocked / review**, each pre-flighted against the gate's cycle check (the `optimize.mjs` report). |
| `fragment.json` | The raw extractor output (atomic nodes + edges) before clustering — the pipeline's first stage. |

## Query the graph (for agents & humans)

Once `graph.json` exists, `scripts/query.mjs` answers the structural questions agents need
before they edit — read-only, deterministic, no LLM in the loop:

```
node scripts/query.mjs <graph.json> --impact  <symbol>   # mapped call/inherit/reference consumers + domains
node scripts/query.mjs <graph.json> --callers <symbol>   # direct callers
node scripts/query.mjs <graph.json> --callees <symbol>   # direct callees
node scripts/query.mjs <graph.json> --cycles             # file-level dependency cycles (SCCs)
node scripts/query.mjs <graph.json> --orphans            # uncalled & unexported (dead-code candidates)
```

`<symbol>` is a node id (`file:label`) or a bare label. A label matching several nodes operates
on the union. Add `--json` for machine-readable output.

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` symbol not found, `2` usage/IO error. Example:

```
$ node scripts/query.mjs .codeweb/graph.json --impact lib/state-store/index.js:get
impact of lib/state-store/index.js:get: 120 functions across 12 domains
```

> `--orphans` is a *candidate* list: codeweb prefers a missing edge to an invented one, so
> genuinely-called functions and entrypoints can surface here — cross-check before deleting.

## Guard agent edits (`diff`)

`scripts/diff.mjs` compares two `graph.json` snapshots (before vs after an edit) and flags
structural **regressions**, so it can run as a PostToolUse hook or CI gate:

```
node scripts/diff.mjs <before.json> <after.json> [--json]
```

The verdict:

- **Exits 1** on a new dependency cycle, a new body-confirmed duplication finding, or an
  existing non-exported symbol that becomes an orphan. Exported symbols are exempt here. These checks cover the mapped graph; unresolved
  dependencies can be absent.
- Pure removals do not count as structural regressions; this says nothing about their behavioral safety.
- A brand-new uncalled function never trips it — agents add functions before wiring them up.

The edit preflight (`codeweb_simulate` and the post-edit hook) also flags exported symbols
that lose their last mapped call-caller. It is a separate check from the diff’s orphan gate.
See [the gate contract](ci-gate.md).

For the installed-binary snapshot workflow, copy the full map to `before.json` **before** editing. Rebuild the full
map after each edit or repair and compare it with that same saved file. Keep the baseline
outside the regenerated workspace; the [quickstart](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/start.html#npm-quickstart) supplies every command.

**Codeweb 0.15.0 and later:** follow [the explicit-baseline workflow](cli.md#before-and-after-an-edit):
`codeweb_refresh {baseline:true}` before editing, then
`codeweb_diff {before:"baseline",refresh:true}` after editing and each repair.

Inspect `analysis.checks` in responses. Refresh drops overlap evidence, so its
diff does not evaluate duplication. `ok:true` means no regressions were found by the
checks performed; it does not prove behavior or complete runtime dependency coverage.
Run the project’s tests too.

## Gate every PR (GitHub Action)

`scripts/ci-gate.mjs` runs the same verdict on every pull request. It maps the PR base and head,
then **fails the build on a structural regression**.

Drop it into any repo (full spec: [`ci-gate.md`](ci-gate.md)):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/codeweb-gate.yml
on: pull_request
jobs:
  gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { fetch-depth: 0 }   # required — the gate diffs against the PR base
      - uses: GhostlyGawd/codeweb/.github/actions/codeweb-gate@v0.16.1
        with: { target: src, comment: true, codeweb-ref: v0.16.1 }   # comment posts the review on the PR
```

Locally: `node scripts/ci-gate.mjs --base <ref> [--target <subdir>]`. Pure removals do not count as structural regressions; a brand-new uncalled function is reported but doesn't fail the build.

## Advise consolidations (`optimize.mjs`)

Where `diff.mjs` *gates* (pass/fail on an edit), `optimize.mjs` *advises*: it reads a graph's
body-confirmed `overlaps[]` and ranks the `duplicate-logic` findings into consolidation
opportunities, **pre-flighting each proposed merge against the gate's own cycle check** — without
editing a line of source.

```
node scripts/optimize.mjs <graph.json> [--json]   # or set CODEWEB_WS
```

Each opportunity lands in one of three tiers:

- **ready** — the copies match, and the simulated merge passes the gate. Safe to apply.
- **blocked** — the naive merge would create a new dependency cycle. Needs a neutral home first.
- **review** — the copies have drifted, or confidence is structural-only. A human (or agent) decides.

For each merge it names the surviving copy and reports what gets removed, which callers get
rewired, and the lines reclaimed. It is **advisory only** — it never writes code; applying the
merge stays a human + gate decision.

## Track duplication over time (`trend.mjs`)

A one-shot map tells you where you are; `trend.mjs` tells you which way you're heading — is the
codebase consolidating or sprawling? It charts **body-confirmed duplication** and **cross-domain
coupling** across snapshots, with a sparkline and a rising/falling verdict:

```
node scripts/trend.mjs --git <repo> --last 10 [--focus <subdir>] [--json]   # snapshot the last N commits
node scripts/trend.mjs a.json b.json c.json [--labels …] [--json]           # or chart pre-built snapshots
```

`--git` maps each of the last N commits in an ephemeral worktree. Your working tree stays
untouched. Watch duplication trend down as you consolidate — or catch it creeping up in review.

## Find the hotspots — where to refactor first (`hotspots.mjs`)

In a large repo the first question is *where do I even start?* `hotspots.mjs` ranks every symbol by
**complexity × fan-in × churn** — the riskiest, most-depended-on, most-churned code first.
Complexity comes free from the body scan; churn is optional (`--git`, or `--churn <map.json>`).

```
$ node scripts/hotspots.mjs <graph.json>
codeweb hotspots: axios/lib — 253 symbol(s) ranked by complexity x fan-in x churn
  weights: complexity 0.5, fanIn 0.3, churn 0.2
  0.533  adapters/fetch.js:factory  [cx 147 in 1 churn 0]
  0.347  adapters/http.js:httpAdapter  [cx 102 in 0 churn 0]
  0.312  core/mergeConfig.js:mergeConfig  [cx 33 in 6 churn 0]
  0.270  helpers/toFormData.js:toFormData  [cx 50 in 3 churn 0]
```

Every row shows its raw components, so the ranking is auditable rather than a black box. Add `--json`
for machine output; also surfaced as the `codeweb_hotspots` MCP tool.

## Plan a whole optimization campaign (`campaign.mjs`)

`campaign.mjs` composes the three advisors — `optimize`, `deadcode`, `break-cycles` — into **one
ordered, ROI-ranked worklist**. Applying the steps in order never introduces a new cycle.

The plan is read-only. codeweb never writes source; your agents (plus the gate) execute each step.

```
$ node scripts/campaign.mjs <graph.json>
codeweb campaign: axios/lib — 80 step(s): 2 cut, 77 delete, 1 merge
  projected: -12 LOC, 2 cycle(s) broken (all steps stay gate-green in order)
  [DELETE] adapters/fetch.js:duplex  (roi 0; +0 LOC, +0 cycle; cumulative -0 LOC)
  …each of 80 steps tagged [CUT|DELETE|MERGE] with its own gate verdict + cumulative delta
```

`--budget N` keeps the top-N ROI prefix; `--json` emits per-step `{op, gate:{ok}, delta, cumulative,
roi}`. Also surfaced as `codeweb_campaign`.

## Onboard in dependency order (`reading-order.mjs`)

To understand a codebase — or one domain — fast, `reading-order.mjs` emits a **foundations-first**
reading path: the depended-upon leaves before the orchestrators that call them, bounded to a budget.
A curated tour instead of blind grep.

```
$ node scripts/reading-order.mjs <graph.json> --budget 6
codeweb reading-order: 6 symbol(s) — read top-down (foundations first):
    1. core/AxiosError.js:AxiosError
        foundation — 18 in-scope caller(s)
    2. cancel/CanceledError.js:CanceledError
        foundation — 5 in-scope caller(s)
    …
```

Scope it with `--scope domain|file|symbol <value>`; cycles degrade gracefully (members ordered by
fan-in, never a crash). Deterministic and read-only; also the `codeweb_reading_order` MCP tool.

## Measured coverage — "is this symbol actually tested?" (`coverage.mjs`)

`codeweb_tests` answers from test-kind call edges (a heuristic). Feed codeweb a real coverage
report and the answers become **measured**:

```
node --test --experimental-test-coverage --test-reporter=lcov > lcov.info   # Node's own runner
node scripts/coverage.mjs .codeweb/graph.json lcov.info                      # or a c8/istanbul JSON
```

Every instrumented symbol gets `covered`/`hits` facts. Query answers then say `covered by the
recorded run` — or, the loud one, `⚠ NOT covered by the recorded test run` — before agents edit
an unguarded symbol.

The feature is optional. Without a coverage input, graphs are byte-identical to before.

## Agent tools — context & pre-flight (`context-pack`, `simulate-edit`)

Two read-only tools that move work off the LLM and into the graph:

```
node scripts/context-pack.mjs  <graph.json> <symbol> [--json]   # minimal context to edit <symbol>
node scripts/simulate-edit.mjs <graph.json> --delete <sym> | --merge <a,b> [--into <id>] | --move <sym> --to <file>
```

`context-pack` returns a bounded source window for one mapped symbol: its body, mapped callers
with lexical source windows, its callees, and the mapped impact set. Agents work from a small window instead of whole files.

`simulate-edit` predicts the gate's verdict for a delete, merge, or move **without performing
it**. Doomed edits get discarded before any code is written.

Both share `optimize.mjs`'s graph primitives, pinned by property tests.

## Agent capability suite (write · review · optimize)

A set of read-only, deterministic tools that make agents better at the three jobs — each pinned by
property tests against an independent reference implementation
(full spec: [`agent-tools-v2.md`](agent-tools-v2.md)):

| Tool | Job | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `find-similar.mjs <graph> --body/--stdin/--signature [--structural]` | **write** | "Does code like this already exist?" — ranks existing bodies by similarity to a candidate; `--structural` also catches renamed (Type-2) clones. Reuse instead of re-implementing. |
| `placement.mjs <graph> --calls <ids>` | **write** | Where a new symbol belongs (domain + file by callee gravity) and whether it duplicates something. |
| `query.mjs <graph> --tests <symbol>` | **write** | The tests that exercise a symbol — run the right subset after an edit. |
| `review.mjs <graph> --changed <files> [--before g] [--gate]` | **review** | Maps a change to its changed symbols, blast radius, domains, and a fan-in-ranked review order; structural regression gate. |
| `fitness.mjs <graph> --rules codeweb.rules.json` | **review** | Checks architectural invariants (forbidden deps, layering, no-cycles, fan-in/loc caps); fails on violation. |
| `risk.mjs <graph> [--changed] [--churn/--git]` | **review** | Ranks symbols by change-risk (fan-in × fan-out × loc × blast × churn) for triage. |
| `codemod.mjs <graph> --merge <ids> --into <id> [--write]` | **optimize** | Plans a consolidation merge (deletions + caller rewrites + projected gate); `--write` applies it, gated + reversible. |
| `break-cycles.mjs <graph>` | **optimize** | For each dependency cycle, the cheapest edge to sever — *verified* to break it. |
| `deadcode.mjs <graph>` | **optimize** | Tiers orphans into safe-to-delete vs review-first (test-guarded / entrypoint-like). |
| `annotate.mjs --suppress <fingerprint> [--note …]` | **review** | Records a false-positive suppression in `.codeweb/annotations.json` (never touches source); `overlap`/`deadcode` then hide that finding and report a `suppressedCount`. Fingerprints are identity-based, so a genuinely *new* issue can't hide behind an old suppression. |

Plus **graph freshness**: `refresh.mjs` re-extracts from disk, so mid-edit queries stay accurate.
The cache re-scans only changed files. Test-file edges carry a distinct `test` kind, so
production `--callers` answers exclude tests.

## The MCP server, tool by tool

`scripts/mcp-server.mjs` exposes **28** tools over MCP. The September 14 packaged assessment exercised the
baseline loop with Codex CLI 0.154.0; it did not test Claude runtime compatibility or
certify all tools across clients. See [assessment scope](../reports/paperclip-pilot/readiness-01/PACKAGED-ACCEPTANCE.md). In the order
your agents meet them:

- **Orient** — `codeweb_map` builds the graph; `codeweb_brief` is the day-one repo page (call it
  first); `codeweb_find` turns free text like *"retry backoff"* into ranked starting symbols.
- **Read the structure** — `codeweb_callers`, `callees`, `impact`, `cycles`, `orphans`, `tests`,
  and `explain` (one symbol, everything known about it).
- **Before writing** — `codeweb_find_similar` (does this already exist?), `placement` (where does
  a new symbol belong?), `context` (the minimal window needed to edit a symbol).
- **Gate the edit** — `codeweb_simulate` preflights a delete/merge/move. Follow the
  [version-specific snapshot workflow](#guard-agent-edits-diff) for verification; use
  `review`, `fitness`, and `risk` for PR time.
- **Clean up** — `codeweb_hotspots`, `deadcode`, `break_cycles`, `campaign`, `reading_order`,
  `codemod` (plan-only over MCP — `--write` is not exposed).
- **Housekeeping** — `codeweb_annotate` (false-positive suppressions, kept in a sidecar, never in
  source) and `codeweb_stats` (the local value receipt).

Register it from npm (or a clone):

```
claude mcp add codeweb -- npx -y -p @ghostlygawd/codeweb codeweb-mcp
claude mcp add codeweb -- node /abs/path/to/codeweb/scripts/mcp-server.mjs   # clone variant
```

or in an `.mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "codeweb": { "command": "node", "args": ["/abs/path/to/codeweb/scripts/mcp-server.mjs"] } } }
```

The server handshake teaches the explicit-baseline loop. Installed binaries can also
compare a saved full map against rebuilt snapshots, as described
[above](#guard-agent-edits-diff). Query results describe mapped dependencies; dynamic or
unresolved callers can be absent.

Known unsupported declarations, unresolved local JSX and ambiguous call targets make gate comparisons inconclusive,
with `ok:false`, diagnostic locations, and CLI exit 2. See [incomplete extraction](cli.md#known-incomplete-extraction).
An unflagged graph does not prove full extraction coverage.
