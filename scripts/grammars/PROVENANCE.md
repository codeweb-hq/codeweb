# Vendored tree-sitter grammars

These `.wasm` grammar files are **vendored on purpose** (committed to the repo) so the optional
tree-sitter engine is offline-reproducible and **determinism is pinned to an exact grammar version** —
the same input always yields the same graph. Recorded in `meta.engine` when the tree-sitter engine runs.

The digests are load-bearing, not decorative: `tests/grammar-provenance.test.mjs` recomputes each
file's sha256 against this table, so a swapped or tampered grammar fails the gate — "pinned and
verified" is machine-checked, never a claim on faith (LNG-F2; the determinism suite proves
same-input-same-output, which says nothing about grammar identity).

## Runtime

The WASM runtime is `web-tree-sitter@0.26.9`, declared in the root `package.json` as an
**optionalDependency** — the regex engine (the default) needs zero dependencies; the tree-sitter tier
is opt-in. If the runtime is not installed, the engine reports unavailable and the extractor falls back
to the regex path per-file.

## The ABI rule (do not skip)

A grammar `.wasm` must sit inside the runtime's ABI window. `tree-sitter-wasms@0.1.13` ships ABI-13
grammars (built with `tree-sitter-cli@0.20.x`) that **fail to load** against `web-tree-sitter@0.26.9`
with a `dylink` metadata error. Always vendor a grammar whose ABI matches the pinned runtime, and bump
both together. The spike that established this was `spike/tree-sitter/` (PR #17; the graduated
prototype was removed from the tree in the perf-quality round — git history keeps it).

## The second trusted source — official tree-sitter org releases (2026-08-18)

`tree-sitter-c.wasm` is the first grammar here that did **not** come from
`@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm`: that package ships no C grammar, and C is the language C++ support is
incomplete without. Charter non-goal 8, as amended by A2, admits a second source under a bar that
is narrower than "any wasm on the internet" and identical in what it guarantees:

1. **The publisher is the grammar's own maintainer** — the `tree-sitter` GitHub org, which is also
   the runtime's publisher. Not a repackager, not a mirror.
2. **The artifact is an immutable release asset**, cited by its exact download URL and tag in the
   table above (a release asset is content-addressed by this file's sha256 either way).
3. **The bytes are pinned and machine-checked** by `tests/grammar-provenance.test.mjs`, exactly
   like every `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm` row — the digest is what makes the source's identity
   load-bearing rather than a claim on faith.
4. **The ABI is verified against the pinned runtime before vendoring** (ABI 15, loaded under
   `web-tree-sitter@0.26.9` — see the ABI rule above).

What has NOT changed: an unpinned, unverified, or third-party-repackaged wasm is still out. The
Kotlin/Swift blocker below is unaffected — no upstream tree-sitter org release ships their wasm.

## Kotlin / Swift — recorded blocker (2026-07-21)

Kotlin and Swift stay **regex-only**: no trusted prebuilt wasm exists at our ABI. The upstream
grammar packages (`tree-sitter-kotlin`, `@tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-kotlin`,
`tree-sitter-swift`) ship C sources and native `.node` prebuilds — building wasm requires an
emscripten toolchain this project deliberately doesn't carry, and vendoring a third-party wasm of
unknown provenance would break this file's guarantee. Revisit when `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm`
grows either language (it added Ruby/PHP in the 0.3.x line) or a maintainer produces a pinned
emscripten build. Until then their dispatch edges are absent, not guessed — the same honesty as
every other gap.

## JSON — no grammar, by design (2026-07-27)

The JSON config tier maps imported `.json` files as file-level `<module>` nodes: membership in
the import-resolution universe plus a stat/hash staleness stamp. File **content is never
parsed** — no symbols are extracted, so there is no parser in the loop and nothing to vendor or
pin; the determinism guarantee holds trivially. If per-key symbols ever become a goal, that
upgrade re-enters this file's discipline (a pinned parser with recorded provenance) before it
ships. (Charter note: whether data formats fall under non-goal 8 at all is an open operator
question, recorded in `CHARTER.md` Open questions.)

## Refreshing a grammar

```sh
npm i -D @vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@<version>
cp node_modules/@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm/wasm/tree-sitter-typescript.wasm scripts/grammars/
# 1. update the version/ABI/sha256 row above (sha256sum scripts/grammars/*.wasm)
# 2. update the meta.engine version stamp in scripts/lib/ts-engine.mjs (it names the grammar
#    package version + ABI — a bump without this stamps a lie into every graph)
# 3. bump web-tree-sitter if the ABI moved; re-run the determinism + grammar-provenance tests
```

From the second source (an official tree-sitter org release), the same three steps apply — only
the fetch differs, and the digest is verified BEFORE the file enters the tree, never after:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/tree-sitter-c.wasm \
  https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c/releases/download/v0.24.2/tree-sitter-c.wasm
shasum -a 256 /tmp/tree-sitter-c.wasm   # must equal the row above before copying
cp /tmp/tree-sitter-c.wasm scripts/grammars/
```

Each release, the prep checklist re-inventories `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@latest`'s wasm list —
the recorded Kotlin/Swift blocker (above) resolves the moment the trusted source ships those
grammars, and a checklist line is what notices (LNG-F7). The C/C++ question is now closed on both
halves (2026-08-18): C++ vendored from `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm`, which already shipped
`tree-sitter-cpp.wasm`, under the ordinary bar; C vendored from the tree-sitter org release under
the second-source bar above, because that package ships no C grammar at all.
