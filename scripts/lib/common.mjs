// `.mts` sources, which only means something if those files are enumerated in the first place.

// is claimed by C: it is the header extension of BOTH languages, and extension is the only
// evidence a static reader has — so it maps to the language whose extension it unambiguously is,
// and a C++ project's headers still map (the two share one rule set).
