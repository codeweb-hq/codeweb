// codeweb MCP server — stdio transport, newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, zero-dependency. Exposes
// codeweb's structural queries as MCP tools an agent can call mid-task. Each tools/call shells out
// to the tested CLI artifact (what ships is what's tested).
//
// Agent-efficiency contract (the token flip):
//   - `graph` is OPTIONAL everywhere: explicit arg > CODEWEB_WS > nearest `.codeweb/graph.json`
//     walking up from cwd. A missing graph returns an ACTIONABLE error naming codeweb_map.
//   - Responses are BUDGETED by default: list-heavy tools get a per-tool default limit (top-N by
//     relevance + explicit `more.remaining`); pass `full: true` (or an explicit limit) to override.
//     A budgeted call answers in ~1-2k tokens where the old behavior could exceed an entire context.
//   - codeweb_map builds/rebuilds the graph so the loop never dead-ends on "graph not found".
//
// CRITICAL: stdout carries ONLY JSON-RPC messages (one per line). Any stray write to stdout
// corrupts the stream for the client, so stdout stays pure. stderr is SILENT by default; the opt-in
// CODEWEB_MCP_TRACE=1 emits one NDJSON queue event per line on stderr (start/end/kill/skip-
// autorefresh) for by-mechanism scenario assertions — free-form on stderr, so it cannot corrupt the
// protocol, and every trace write is try/catch-guarded (a client may close stderr — the #29 lesson).
