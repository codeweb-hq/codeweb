description: Dissect a codebase to atomic nodes (functions, classes, symbols), wire the call/import web, tag each node's domain, and build a cross-domain overlap graph that ranks consolidation/de-duplication opportunities, then render an interactive HTML map. Use to restructure your own codebase into well-defined non-duplicative systems, OR to fully map and review an external repo (git URL / owner-repo) before adopting it. Triggers include "map this codebase", "dependency/relationship graph", "find duplication/overlap", "atomic dissection", "review this repo before I use it", and the /codeweb command.

# Codebase Anatomy (codeweb)

Build a structural map of the system. Each function, class, method, or exported symbol is a node.
Calls, imports, and inheritance relationships are edges. Each node belongs to a domain. An
**overlap graph** identifies separate parts that do the same work.

The result is an **evidence-backed restructuring plan**. It identifies the duplicated logic that
can move into one defined system and the symbols that must depend on that system.

## When to Use

- Restructuring your own codebase and you need to *see* the real dependency web and where it's
  duplicative before moving code.
- Onboarding to a large or legacy system at symbol resolution, including relationships across
  folders.
- Reviewing an **external** repo (a plugin, library, or template you found on GitHub) end-to-end
  before adopting it — what it does, how it's wired, and whether it's worth committing to.
- Hunting cross-cutting duplication that file/module tools miss (the same check coded N times in
  N domains).

## Two Modes

- **internal** — analyze the current project; produce a domain map + overlap graph + restructure
  recommendations.
- **external** — `target` is a git URL or `owner/repo`. Clone it **read-only** to a temp dir,
  map it the same way, and add an **adoption review** (risk, dependencies, architecture verdict,
  "should you adopt this?").

Auto-detect: a URL or `owner/repo` ⇒ external; a path or `.` ⇒ internal. `--mode` overrides.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Never execute the target.** No build, run, test, install, or entrypoint — for internal or
  external code. Only read files and invoke read-only static-analysis tools that inspect files
  already on disk. This is absolute for external repos (their toolchain can run their code).
- **Evidence over guesswork.** Every node, edge, domain, and overlap must trace to code you read
  or a tool emitted. When unsure of an edge or an overlap, omit it or mark it `low` — never
  inflate. A report that cries wolf is worse than no report.
- **No silent truncation.** If you cap depth, sample, or skip files, say so in the report and in
  `meta`. Coverage gaps must be visible.
- **One graph, one schema.** Everything conforms to `references/graph-schema.md`. The HTML
  renderer and all agents depend on it.
- **Reuse, don't reinvent.** If they're installed, hand off to `repo-scan` (file/library
  classification), `codebase-onboarding` (guides), `refactor-cleaner` (acting on the list) rather
  than redoing their jobs. These are optional separate skills — when absent, do the step inline
  (each Handoffs entry names its one-line alternative). Never search for or apologize about a
  skill that isn't there.

## Outputs (under `<target>/.codeweb/`)

1. `graph.json` — the web: `nodes`, `edges`, `domains`, `overlaps`, plus `meta` (roles,
   staleness stamps, stats).
2. `report.html` — self-contained interactive map (force graph, domain tree, node details,
   ranked overlap tab; product-only filter by default). No network/CDN.
3. `report.md` — the same map as plain markdown (mermaid domain graph + overlaps).
4. `overlap.md` — the ranked consolidation opportunities in plain markdown.
5. `optimize.md` — the consolidation advisory (ready / blocked / review tiers).
6. `fragment.json` — the raw extractor output (pipeline stage 1).
7. (external mode) an adoption review section appended to `overlap.md` and your final summary.

## References

- `references/graph-schema.md` — the exact JSON shape and merge rules. **Read before dissecting.**
- `references/engine-detection.md` — the hybrid engine: which analysis tool per language, how to
  probe for it, and depth/scaling rules.
- `references/overlap-heuristics.md` — the four overlap kinds and the severity rubric.

## Core Workflow

### 0 — Scope & acquire

- Parse `target`, `--depth`, `--engine`, `--focus`, `--mode`, `--open`.
- internal: resolve the path (default `.`). external: `git clone --depth 1 <url>` into a temp
  dir (e.g. `${TMPDIR}/codeweb-<repo>`); **do not** run anything inside it.
- Detect languages, package managers, and repo size (`rg --files | wc -l`). Choose effective
  depth: `auto` ⇒ module-level overview, then symbol-level on the densest/most-overlapping
  subsystems. Probe for analysis tools per `engine-detection.md`; record the engine — the
  `meta.engine` value (hybrid | tools | read) is the map's provenance label: downstream
  surfaces (codeweb_brief, the session brief) caveat agent-built maps as unverified, so
  always stamp it (AC-12).

### Fast path (default) — one-command deterministic engine

For languages the bundled extractor handles (**JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, C, C++**), run the whole
pipeline in a single command instead of dissecting by hand. It is faster, cheaper, and
reproducible, and emits the same `graph.json` schema:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run.mjs" "<target>" --target "<label>"
```

The command runs these stages:

1. extract symbols and edges
2. cluster directory-anchored domains
3. confirm duplication from function bodies
4. create consolidation advice
5. render the reports

The command writes `fragment.json`, `graph.json`, `overlap.md`, `optimize.md`, `report.html`, and
`report.md` to `<target>/.codeweb` by default. The MCP server and all three hooks use this
location. Use `--out-dir` to select a different location.

The script reads the target and resolves its own paths, so you can run it from any current
directory. When the command succeeds, skip steps 1–5 and continue at step 6. Use the agent-based
passes for an unsupported language, an explicit `--engine read`, or a low-confidence finding that
needs more evidence.

### 1 — Survey & partition (agent-based fallback; skip if the fast path ran)

- Build the subsystem map: top-level source dirs / packages, excluding vendored and build dirs
  (lean on `repo-scan`'s classification idea — project vs third-party vs artifact).
- Partition the project code into ~4–12 scopes of comparable size. These are the parallel units.

### 2 — Dissect (parallel `codeweb-dissector`)

- Spawn one `codeweb-dissector` per scope **in parallel** (single message, multiple agents).
  Pass each: its scope, the engine mode, the detected tools, and the node/edge schema.
- Each returns `{nodes, edges}` for its slice. They may reference ids outside their scope.
- If subagents aren't available, run the passes sequentially with the same instructions.

### 3 — Merge

- Union all nodes (dedupe by `id`) and edges (unique by `from,to,kind`; sum `weight`).
- Drop edges whose endpoints aren't in the node set (dangling refs to skipped code).

### 4 — Domain-map & overlap (`codeweb-domain-mapper`)

- Pass the merged `{nodes, edges}` to one `codeweb-domain-mapper` with `overlap-heuristics.md`.
- It returns per-node `domain`, a `domains[]` summary, and ranked `overlaps[]`. Merge `domain`
  back onto each node by `id`; attach `domains` and `overlaps` to the graph.

### 5 — Stamp & render

- Write `.codeweb/graph.json`.
- Run the renderer:
  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build-report.mjs" "<target>/.codeweb/graph.json"
  ```
  (add `--open` to launch it). It computes `meta.stats`, stamps `generatedAt`, drops any
  remaining dangling edges, writes the normalized graph back to `graph.json`, and writes
  `report.html` + `report.md` beside it.

### 6 — Overlap.md + summary

- Write `overlap.md`: the ranked overlaps as a checklist — title, kind, severity, the symbols
  involved, evidence, and the named consolidation target. This is the restructure plan.
- Report to the user: artifact paths, the domain count, and the **top 3–5 consolidation
  opportunities** with their recommendations.

### 7 — External adoption review (external mode only)

Append an adoption verdict: what the repo is and does (from the domain map), notable
dependencies and risk surface (lean on `security-review` / `repo-scan` signals), architecture
quality (cohesion vs the overlap graph), and a clear **adopt / adapt / avoid** recommendation
with reasons.

**Record the reviewed commit**: run `git rev-parse HEAD` in the clone and put the SHA in the
verdict's first line — a ruling without the commit it judged is a claim without a source.
Then clean up the temp clone.

## Scaling

Follow `engine-detection.md`: module depth for first pass and huge repos; expand to symbol depth
on the top subsystems by size and cross-domain edge density. If total nodes would exceed ~2000,
cap symbol expansion to the focus area and state it. The HTML renderer auto-starts in
domain-aggregated view above ~600 nodes and lets the user expand.

## Execute the campaign (`/codeweb-apply`)

When the user asks you to apply the consolidation plan, follow `commands/apply.md` exactly. Apply
only **ready-tier merges**.

For each merge, simulate → apply with `codemod.mjs --write` → refresh → run the diff gate → run
the mapped test subset → commit. If a gate fails, revert the merge and record the gate's reason.
Do not override a failed diff or test.

End with this receipt:
`applied N merge(s) · −L LOC · blocked B · gate green`.

## Handoffs

Each of these is a separate skill that may or may not be installed. When one is absent, the
inline alternative **is** the step — do that instead of searching or apologizing:

- `refactor-cleaner` (if installed) — execute the consolidation list. Else: apply the top
  **ready** merge from `optimize.md` yourself, then re-run `/codeweb` to verify the delta.
- `codebase-onboarding` (if installed) — turn the domain map into an onboarding guide. Else: a
  short ONBOARDING.md from the brief (areas, load-bearing symbols, test dirs) covers it.
- `code-tour` (if installed) — anchor a guided tour to the symbol index. Else: walk
  `scripts/reading-order.mjs` output top to bottom — it is the tour, minus the narration.
- `repo-scan` (if installed) — deeper file-level / third-party classification. Else: the roles
  codeweb already stamps on every node (product / test / tooling / vendored) cover the common case.
