# SPEC — codeweb

Created 2026-07-26; product clarity added 2026-09-05; baseline and documentation work
integrated 2026-09-14. CHARTER.md records the ratified direction and later amendments.
A built criterion records implementation and test pins, not release or deployment.

Main's AC-13–20 retain their identities. The independently developed baseline/documentation
criteria are appended as AC-21–26 to avoid identifier collisions during integration.

## Job

**"See what your AI edits affect."** Your agents inspect callers and dependencies before an edit,
then check new structural findings afterward. The local graph supplies bounded answers through
MCP; interfaces are defined in `scripts/lib/tool-specs.mjs` and behavior in `scripts/mcp-server.mjs`. The supporting report explains those results.

## Non-goals

From the charter's ratified list — scope creep dies here:

- No resident daemon (`docs/decisions/fastpath-daemon.md`, NO-GO).
- No embeddings or vector search — `find` stays deterministic-lexical.
- No LLM inside the runtime analysis path.
- No accounts, telemetry, or license keys in the local product, ever.
- No VS Code Marketplace publish (the .vsix still builds per release). *(Amendment A1,
  2026-08-17: the hosted "Teams" build is green-lit and its distribution trigger superseded,
  so that half of this line is gone; non-goal 6 was re-examined the same day and stands.)*
- No new first-class language until its parser grammar clears
  `scripts/grammars/PROVENANCE.md` provenance.
- The human-facing map stays a supporting view of the findings — never the lead.
- The parked A/B experiments run only on an explicit operator go.

## Buyer and the first dollar

The user is the agent-heavy individual developer working their own repo; everything local is
free forever (MIT — charter invariant). There is deliberately no paywall and no license key:
the wired money path is **GitHub Sponsors** (the README Support section and the site support
page link it), sponsorship simply supports the project, and sponsors get featured README
placement — no cost claims (charter C7 ruling). The team lead is the secondary audience,
reached through the gate's PR comments; the paid tier they are offered is **codeweb Teams**,
a separate hosted service green-lit on 2026-08-17 (amendment A1) and priced as intent at ~€10
per active author per month. The boundary holds either way: billing lives only in that
service, never in this repo, so the local product keeps taking no accounts, no telemetry, and
no license keys. Brief 144's first-dollar lens verifies the sponsor doorway exists and
resolves; it cannot verify a stranger's card, and this spec claims nothing more.

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-39** — Codex local configuration checks recognize the canonical package recipe and an installed direct binary with optional args omitted, distinguish disabled/ambiguous/foreign entries without executing or revealing supplied values, and retain actual host connection as unverified | check: `node --test tests/codex-launch-recipes.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-40** — the focused Codeweb coding skill ships beside the static runtime, references live MCP operations, tracks the package version and supports mapped source inspection/reuse/structural review without depending on Claude-only shell variables | check: `node --test tests/codex-workflow-packaging.test.mjs` | status: built

- **AC-37** — lexical block/parameter bindings, JSX executable declaration boundaries and namespace export surfaces avoid the reproduced false facts and cleanup proposals; immutable aliases and literal decorators expose affected consumers, while unsupported aliases/factories are diagnosed; cold/warm/full caches retain resolution and export changes invalidate old edges | check: `node --test tests/inversion-correctness.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-38** — informational find/explain/context/risk answers retain useful partial results with shared typed completeness on CLI and MCP; incomplete decision gates remain inconclusive and cleanup proposals remain withheld; missing matches are qualified and repaired graphs recover without restart | check: `node --test tests/inversion-transport.test.mjs` | status: built

- **AC-36** — supported JSX component and function-value uses resolve through lexical/import bindings without fabricated direct calls; reference users participate in impact and all blast counters; unresolved usage and ambiguous call targets retain bounded completeness diagnostics through caches; JSX, dynamic and incomplete cleanup candidates require review across CLI/MCP | check: `node --test tests/static-usages.test.mjs` | status: built

AC-36 tightens AC-35 cleanup classification: the legacy tier keys remain, while incomplete
or dynamic maps and JSX component orphans now require review.

Grammar (parsed by `scripts/spec_lint.py` — one line per AC):
`- **AC-n** — <criterion> | check: ` `` `<command>` `` ` | status: next|built|dropped`

The structured trace and verification companion is

- **AC-22** — context JSON distinguishes list and source-evidence completeness from graph uncertainty, reports unknown freshness without stamps, and gives actionable recovery steps identically through CLI and MCP | check: `node --test tests/context-analysis.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-23** — an explicit pre-edit baseline survives ordinary and automatic refreshes; one diff refreshes and compares against it, reports skipped checks, and fails actionably without a valid baseline | check: `node --test tests/edit-baseline.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-24** — setup diagnostics report the running installation, discovered graph, source freshness, parser availability, and local repair commands without modifying the workspace | check: `node --test tests/doctor.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-25** — first-run CLI, README and start-page guidance capture an explicit pre-edit baseline and preserve it through repair; the published tiny cycle walkthrough finds a caller, goes red then green, and discloses skipped analysis and behavioral limits | check: `node --test tests/first-run.test.mjs tests/first-use-cycle.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-26** — shipped hook metadata omits settings schema and matcher-level metadata, preserves adjacent descriptions and all three handler commands, and passes fixture-driven handler checks | check: `node --test tests/hooks-config.test.mjs tests/brief.test.mjs tests/awareness.test.mjs tests/post-edit-diff.test.mjs` | status: built

- **AC-27** — known unsupported JS/TS same-line function, arrow and class declaration layouts carry bounded masked-source diagnostics through extraction, cache, graph and refresh/baseline; either incomplete snapshot makes CLI/MCP diff and review inconclusive (exit 2, false verdict), while supported green and regression controls retain exit 0/1 | check: `node --test tests/analysis-completeness.test.mjs tests/ci-gate.test.mjs` | status: built

### Evidence reconciliation (implemented locally, unreleased)

The [V1 implementation specification](docs/specs/evidence-reconciliation.md) defines
explicit task-owned context receipts and answer-specific reconciliation in review.
AC-30–33 are implemented and pinned by the evidence suites. Their detailed trace is
the feature specification’s ER-T01–20 matrix and implementation verification report.
The requirements companion retains its separately reviewed historical baseline. Automatic hooks, multi-symbol boundary packets and
API adapters remain outside V1.

- **AC-30** — evidence receipts retain canonical queries and complete original relationship sets; reconciliation reports exact mapped deltas and task-owned unresolved questions without semantic resolution claims | check: `node --test tests/evidence-core.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-31** — evidence capture and reconciliation use coherent content-verified source inventories including new files and extraction inputs; incompatible, changing or incomplete analysis cannot validate stale evidence | check: `node --test tests/evidence-snapshot.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-32** — immutable local evidence artifacts enforce schema, digest, workspace and task identity, storage limits and bounded deterministic pagination without partial records or silent omissions | check: `node --test tests/evidence-store.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-33** — explicit CLI and MCP evidence modes agree, return reconciliation on clean-review paths and preserve existing payloads, baselines, verdicts and exit semantics outside the specified opt-in additions | check: `node --test tests/evidence-transport.test.mjs` | status: built

Pins live in `tests/test_ac_pins.py` (`test_ac_<n>_...`); pins are cheap wiring witnesses —
the `check:` commands above are what brief 144 runs verbatim.

- **AC-28** — CLI mapping rejects existing file targets without --out-dir, including file symlinks, with exit 2 and a concise stderr message naming the target and directory recovery action before creating output; explicit-output file mapping, missing targets and supported directory symlinks retain their existing behavior | check: `node --test --test-name-pattern=ac_28 tests/first-use-target.test.mjs` | status: built
- **AC-29** — MCP codeweb_map rejects existing file targets without out with an actionable isError tool result before creating output; explicit-out file mapping remains successful, responses contain no stack trace and the server exits normally after stdin closes | check: `node --test --test-name-pattern=ac_29 tests/first-use-target.test.mjs` | status: built

- **AC-34** — similarity output offers mapped non-test source candidates for comparison without novelty, safety or equivalent-behavior guarantees; human output exposes the existing threshold, body cap and omitted-count expansion while JSON fields, scoring, ranking and exit/error behavior remain compatible | check: `node --test tests/find-similar-output.test.mjs tests/find-similar.test.mjs tests/structural-clone.test.mjs` | status: built

AC-34 pins P-01's similarity-output correction only. The broader native evidence delivery
matrix, actual host delivery and user outcomes remain pending separate verification.

- **AC-35** — deadcode CLI/MCP preserves structural tier keys while carrying source/completeness provenance and no deletion guarantee; served deadcode/impact/campaign descriptions retain mapped-source or simulation limits and bounded expansion without deletion/runtime guarantees; advisory hooks target resolvable mapped edits, retain same-file and external consumers with bounded expansion, qualify file-only/ambiguous/stale/unknown evidence, distinguish mapped invalid/empty/extraction failure from quiet supported and excluded cases, preserve original baselines and permission flow, and work through filesystem entry aliases without optional ctags stderr noise | check: `node --test tests/native-evidence-repairs.test.mjs` | status: built

AC-35 pins P-03's bounded handler and transport repairs (P03-R01–R05/R07 and entry
aliases from conditional R06; NED-01/02/04/05/07/10). The shipped hook metadata
declares Claude Code events and Edit/Write/MultiEdit payloads. Direct handler probes
do not prove trusted client startup or ambient delivery. Codex MCP/skill use remains
separate from unverified Codex ambient delivery, owned by P-04 under NED-08.

## Interfaces

### Product clarity release contract — 2026-09-05

The implementation tasks and validation record are in `docs/specs/product-clarity-tasks.md`.
The user requested independent specification review, implementation, verification, and PR merge.

- Preserve local operation, MIT licensing, no telemetry, no target-code execution, and zero required dependencies.
- Preserve existing MCP tools and mapping flags. Reserve bare `setup`, `doctor`, `review`, and `gate` as CLI subcommands.
- Map directories with reserved names through `./review`, an absolute path, or `codeweb -- review`; document and test this disambiguation.
- Use `See what your AI edits affect.` as the shared headline and `Structural checks for AI code changes.` as the descriptor.
- Keep individual developers as the primary audience. Small teams remain secondary; the graph supports the agent workflow.
- Keep the square shapes and lime accent. Improve text size, sentence case, navigation, and supporting-text contrast within that system.
- Keep historical research and decisions intact. Label historical claims and scope new claims to their evidence.
- Do not modify the protected verification harness, release credentials, branch protections, billing, or marketplace publication.

#### Setup and diagnostics

- `codeweb setup --client <client>` prints a project recipe; it does not overwrite existing user configuration.
- Support Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and Codex with one canonical recipe definition used by setup and diagnostics.
- `codeweb doctor` checks Node compatibility, a local MCP initialization exchange, graph presence and freshness, and supplied client configuration when requested.
- `--client <client> --config <file>` requests an explicit config check. Never search unrelated client profiles or print config contents.
- JSON reports `ok`, `checks` with named `pass|fail|unknown` states, and an explicit unverified editor connection. Required setup failures return 2; a successful local check returns 0.
- Diagnostics must say that a local server check does not establish an editor connection. Missing or invalid required setup returns exit 2.
- JSON is machine-readable on stdout. Diagnostics do not read secrets into output or contact external services.
- A documented first query proves the map can answer a caller question on a small source fixture.

#### Change review

- `codeweb review` exposes the existing review capability through the package. Preserve existing review JSON fields and flags.
- Support optional HTML output with one view of changed symbols, affected callers, new findings, available recorded coverage, and analysis limits.
- Reuse existing graph traversal, comparison, freshness, and coverage data. Do not invent a second graph schema or change gate semantics.
- Distinguish unchecked, stale, or incomplete analysis from a clean result. State when no baseline or source bodies are available.
- Report analysis as `complete`, `incomplete`, or `stale` relative to the named checks, with reasons. Missing baseline, unavailable source/stamps, dynamic gaps, or changed files without mapped symbols prevent a complete label.
- Malformed supplied baselines are errors. Preserve existing advisory versus `--gate` behavior; uncertainty never becomes a runtime-safety claim.
- Report source provenance and only measured coverage. Unknown coverage must remain unknown.
- Escape source-derived text in HTML and generated tasks. Never execute a generated task automatically.

#### Finding decisions

- Label body-match confidence explicitly. A high-confidence duplicate may have low action priority.
- Treat very short duplicates as review candidates; explain that new coupling can outweigh a small reduction in repeated lines.
- Keep the confirmed-finding list separate from name matches. Show source locations, relevant caller context, and a copyable agent task.
- Use existing annotation/exception semantics and fingerprints. Provide an actionable existing command rather than adding a second persistence store.

#### Gate rollout

- `codeweb gate` runs the existing base-versus-working-tree gate through the package.
- An explicit `--report-only` option and Action input report findings without blocking. Preserve the underlying verdict in output.
- Report-only must never turn usage errors, missing refs, failed graph builds, or interrupted analysis into success.
- Existing blocking behavior remains the default. A passing check means only that the named structural rules found no regression.

#### Evidence and public demo

- Rebuild the demo from a recorded public source SHA with the current engine. Record the reproduction command and engine version.
- Rebuild generated site content, inspect every recaptured screenshot, and refresh the template stamp only after visual inspection.
- Publish a dated qualitative comparison with links to primary sources; no unmeasured speed, accuracy, adoption, or cost superiority.
- Provide a reproducible technical demo and a short recording script. Label technical examples separately from maintainer-approved case studies.
- Provide a five-participant pilot protocol and a case-study template with acceptance/rejection fields. Do not fabricate participants, retention, acceptance, or comparative performance.
- Human pilot execution, external maintainer decisions, and an independently measured performance comparison remain external follow-up work. This release is complete when the scoped code and evidence tooling pass their checks.

- **MCP server** — `codeweb-mcp` (stdio): 28 tools over the local graph (impact, callers,
  duplication, context packs …). Interfaces live in `scripts/lib/tool-specs.mjs`; server
  behavior lives in `scripts/mcp-server.mjs`. The consistency checker derives the tool count
  from those sources and checks current prose and package metadata. Unknown arguments are
  rejected; booleans and pagination follow the tested transport contracts.
- **CLI bins** — `codeweb` (map a repo), `codeweb-mcp`, `codeweb-query`, `codeweb-diff`
  (`package.json` `bin`). Contract: `--help` exits 0 (AC-6); unknown flags die with usage,
  exit 2; IO/setup failures exit 2, real findings exit 1, clean exit 0; `--json` modes emit
  machine output on stdout (stdout-contract pins in the suite; `docs/cli.md`).
- **Artifacts** — `.codeweb/` per-target workspace: `graph.json` (nodes/edges), sidecars,
  `report.html` (the supporting human view). Deterministic: same code, same map.
- **Hooks & gate** — the shipped `hooks/` surface (pre-edit impact cards for user repos) and
  the CI gate Action posting PR comments; both read the same graph the MCP tools read.
- **Error shape** — no network, no telemetry; everything answers from local artifacts or
  fails with a usage/setup message and exit 2.

## Evals

Golden cases in `evals/cases/` (`python3 evals/run.py`, gate step 5/5 — AC-7):
`example-upper`, `cli-help`, `mcp-initialize`, `mcp-tools-list` and `query-help`. Floor: **all cases pass** — the runner exits non-zero on any failure.
Judgment-shaped product output (review verdicts, gate rulings) is floored inside the suite
itself: golden-file and property tests (`tests/golden-ecc-scripts.test.mjs`,
`tests/gate-verdict.test.mjs`, FPR-STABLE determinism pins) run under AC-1.

## Dependencies

- Runtime: **none** — zero required dependencies is a charter invariant (AC-3 checks it,
  CI's no-AST leg proves the product works without the optional tier).
- Optional: `web-tree-sitter` (`optionalDependencies`) — the AST tier; predates this spec,
  grandfathered with the no-AST CI leg as its guard.
- Dev tooling: Python 3 for the harness only (spec lint, harness tests, evals) — ADR-0001
  (d) in `DECISIONS.md`; nothing Python ships (AC-5).
- Rule: a Python package added to `requirements.txt` fails the gate unless `DECISIONS.md`
  names it in an ADR (`scripts/spec_lint.py`); Node dependencies stay guarded by review, the
  consistency gate, and the package-shape pins.

## Kill criteria

Measurable tripwires that mean **stop building and fix (or stop, period)** — brief 144
restates these as the first Weekly Vitals checklist:

- **The gate stops being able to fail:** `sh scripts/check --prove-red` reports anything but
  PROVE-RED OK. A harness that cannot go red proves nothing — halt all feature work.
- **A receipt regresses:** the bench caller-recall receipt falls back to the grep baseline
  (charter receipt: 44%→74%) or `npm run bench:all -- --gate` breaks `bench/budgets.json`
  on main twice in a row — stop shipping until the receipt is true again (no claim without
  a source is a charter invariant).
- **Claim drift on main:** `node scripts/check-consistency.mjs` red on main — public copy no
  longer traces to the canonical facts; nothing ships over it.
- **The token half fails:** agent answers stop being small — an MCP budget pin
  (`tests/mcp-budget.test.mjs`) red on main is a stop, not a skip.
