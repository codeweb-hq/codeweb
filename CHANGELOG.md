# Changelog

All notable changes to **codeweb** are recorded here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Beyond the usual change groups, releases also carry **Research** and **Capabilities**
notes so validated results, papers, and new tools never get lost in commit history.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet. Open work lands here before it ships in the next tagged release._

## [0.16.0] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- Preserve live outer calls after block-local shadows and keep JSX text out of declaration discovery. Multiline callback bodies retain their enclosing function/arrow extents. Cleanup/campaign proposals no longer include the reproduced live-function and phantom-text cases.
- Resolve simple immutable callable aliases and literal Python decorator dependencies; qualify unsupported callable aliases and decorator factories. Respect parameter/callback bindings and ES namespace export surfaces, including cache invalidation on visibility changes.
- Keep useful partial find/explain/context/risk results on CLI and MCP with shared in-band completeness. Incomplete decision gates remain inconclusive.
- Map supported JSX component renders and known function values, including Python handler registration and JSX event properties. Impact follows reference consumers; direct-call answers expose reference users separately.
- Keep incomplete or dynamic maps and JSX component-like orphans out of deletion proposals. Preserve unresolved-target and ambiguous-call diagnostics through extraction caches.

### Added
- Bundle a focused `codeweb` coding skill for mapped caller inspection, reuse comparison and structural edit verification in Codex. Document the plugin installation path and recognize an installed `codeweb-mcp` binary in local configuration checks.
- Add opt-in local evidence receipts to context and review. Agents can compare previously mapped callers with a fresh source snapshot and read bounded historical pages. See `docs/cli.md`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Explicit pre-edit baselines survive ordinary and automatic graph refreshes. Agents can
  refresh and verify an edit in one diff call, then check repairs against the same baseline.
- Context responses distinguish list/source-evidence limits from graph uncertainty, with
  actionable freshness and recovery information. Local setup diagnostics report installation,
  graph discovery, source freshness and optional-parser availability without changing source.
- First-use instructions include a tested installed-package cycle walkthrough and a
  baseline-preserving MCP workflow.

### Fixed
- Diagnostic masking recognizes regex statements after multiline control heads while
  preserving division expressions, avoiding false incomplete-analysis reports.
- Package exclusions keep generated Python bytecode and verification-harness caches out
  of the npm artifact, even after the verification suite has run.
- Refreshing verification rejects baselines without valid node and edge arrays before
  changing the live graph. Baseline parsing and fingerprinting use the same bytes.
- Current documentation count checks include SPEC and recognize formatted counts and
  Codeweb possessive phrasing while leaving dated audit and release records historical.
- Known unsupported same-line JavaScript/TypeScript declaration layouts now carry bounded
  source diagnostics. Gates refuse an unqualified clean verdict when either snapshot has
  detected incomplete analysis. This contains the reported false-clean result; it does not
  claim complete syntax coverage or repair every omitted declaration.
- Gate comments use commit links only when the checkout is clean before and after analysis
  and HEAD is unchanged; otherwise locations remain plain text. Comments include bounded
  evidence and investigation guidance.
- Removed unsupported metadata keys from the shipped hook configuration while retaining
  all three handlers and moving their descriptions into adjacent documentation.

### Changed
- Prominent guidance describes mapped-graph limits, exported-symbol exemptions, skipped
  checks, and tested-client scope. Teams availability copy now reflects restricted GitHub
  App access while preserving the ratified planned price and free-local boundary.
- Inconclusive analysis is a non-success result distinct from detected regressions; callers
  must inspect diagnostics rather than interpreting an incomplete comparison as clean.

### Documentation
- Updated contributor guidance, operational graph-schema notes, and a documentation index
  describe the required gate, ownership, provenance, freshness and missing data. Audit
  indexes connect historical findings to implementation and verification records.

### Verification scope
- Runtime analysis remains deterministic, local and free of required third-party dependencies.
  Optional parser installation is not a substitute for the incomplete-analysis checks.
- Structural results do not establish behavioral correctness. Run the relevant product tests.
  Release-candidate test results and artifact hashes are recorded in the accompanying review.

### Also added in product clarity
- Package commands for client setup, local diagnostics, change review, and the existing CI gate.
- Portable change-review HTML with caller evidence, baseline provenance, and explicit analysis limits.
- Report-only gate mode that preserves regression verdicts and still fails on analysis errors.
- A reproducible edit-review demo, a dated Graphify comparison, and pilot and case-study protocols.

### Changed
- Public identity: “See what your AI edits affect.” and “Structural checks for AI code changes.”
- Setup uses shared recipes for five clients and shows an observable caller-query check.
- Findings separate body confidence from priority and provide source evidence and an agent task.
- The public Axios demo is re-extracted from a pinned commit with current engine provenance.
- Agent review details are bounded and report omitted counts; supporting HTML retains full evidence.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- **C and C++ join as first-class languages — 13 native languages ship.** Both follow the
  existing per-language contract (`langOf` + rules, grammar dispatch, regex-tier fallback so the
  AST tier stays optional, fixture-backed extractor suites). `tree-sitter-cpp.wasm` comes from
  the already-pinned `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@0.3.1` (ABI 14); `tree-sitter-c.wasm` comes from
  the tree-sitter org's own GitHub release v0.24.2 (ABI 15) — a second trusted grammar source
  ratified by charter amendment A2, with `PROVENANCE.md` gaining a source column and a sha256
  per wasm. The language count now propagates to every surface by NAME, gated by
  `tests/lang-surfaces.test.mjs`, which encodes the live-versus-historical distinction so dated
  records stay untouched.
- **The free-forever boundary and the Teams price intent are published.** New site pages state
  the ratified contract — anything that runs on one laptop against one repo is free forever;
  money buys hosting, multi-repo aggregation, and human attention — alongside the hosted tier's
  price intent (€10 per active author per month, active author = committed in the last 90 days,
  flat and unlimited). Both pages ride every prose sweep via `PROSE_FILES`, and
  `tests/boundary-pricing.test.mjs` pins the wording on both sides of the boundary.
- **Two launch pages that argue on re-derivable numbers.** An LSP FAQ ("why not just an LSP")
  and a comparison page, both first-class in the site's page table, the sitemap, and
  `PROSE_FILES`, and both reachable by clicking from the homepage. Every number on them traces
  to a committed receipt; the honesty ledger renders straight from `product.json`'s don't-claim
  list, so a receipt re-run moves the page.
- **Three upgrade moments, and the zones that stay ask-free.** The gate comment's footer carries
  an org-dashboard line, the trend rail nudges at five or more snapshots in text mode only, and
  the report footer keeps its attribution. The anti-placements are hard rules with tests: never
  in an MCP tool response, never in a hook card, never on an error path, computed only from
  local counters, one line, and suppressible via `CODEWEB_NO_PROMO=1`.

### Changed
- **The site and README lead with the deterministic regression gate.** The gate is the story;
  the map and graph support it. The ratified identity line is unchanged and still enforced
  verbatim on all four surfaces.
- **The gate Action's examples pin a release tag, and gate adoption is observable.** Copy-paste
  surfaces name the shipped version instead of `@main` (the release roll now keeps them
  current), and the weekly acquisition ledger reports the real status of its adoption search
  instead of silently recording a null when the search cannot connect.

### Fixed
- **Four benchmark instruments repaired, so every number re-derives.** `node bench/run-all.mjs`
  exits 0 again. Every failure was in the instrument, not the product, and all four reproduce at
  pre-release HEAD: the correctness-query oracle dropped `ref` edges the shipped cycle walk has
  always followed (all five families now measure 0 disagreements over 497,864 comparisons);
  edit-safety imported a module deleted in July and crashed at import, taking six hypotheses
  down with it; the auxiliary harness flagged the footer's hyperlink as a network fetch and
  carried a stale tool-count table; and the performance harness tripped over a `/tmp` symlink.
  No published number moved as a consequence of the repairs.
- **Release drift audit (`CLAUDE.md`, 150 · Drift Audit) — two claim-bearing corrections.**
  `product.json`'s F10 "Sharded subgraphs" (mirrored to the product page) advertised a
  capability whose implementation was deleted on 2026-07-19 by a measured decision recorded in
  `bench/results/scale-typescript.json` → `previous.shardsDecision`: the monolithic graph loads
  fast enough at 16k symbols, and the answer-preserving shard contract was never wired to a CLI
  or MCP surface. The feature line is withdrawn rather than restored — the code is gone, and git
  history holds it if a 100k-symbol case ever appears. This resolves charter row C9 the way C8
  was resolved: claim-bearing copy does not ship a feature that does not exist. In the same
  pass, the latency and scaling figures on the honesty ledger and the claim table were refreshed
  from the regenerated `bench/results/performance.json` — they had been stale in the pessimistic
  direction (worst-case p95 51.9 ms on 3,215 symbols, not 264 ms on 3,201).
- **The MCP registry manifest's description said 27 tools while 28 ship.** `server.json`'s
  description was the one tool-count surface no sweep read; it now self-heals through the
  release roll like every other mirrored count.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Evidence-backed README proof and acquisition visuals.** A compact benchmark strip links its
  three claims to the existing research ledger, three conversion badges lead to the npx trial,
  live demo, and Claude Code install, and a zero-dependency renderer turns completed daily npm
  data into an accessible, mobile-readable line chart near the top of the README. Its large
  headline shows the latest seven completed days while the line preserves the daily trend. The
  scheduled acquisition workflow retains the weekly counter ledger and refreshes the chart
  without a new service, secret, or user-level data. The opening section now exposes the copyable
  `npx` command, and the quickstart includes a sanitized terminal replay captured from a real
  0.12.0 run against pinned Zod source.
- **JSON config-file support (file-level).** Imported `.json` files are now first-class map
  nodes: default imports, named imports (TS `resolveJsonModule`), namespace imports,
  `require('./config.json')`, and extensionless `require('./config')` all resolve to a
  `<path>:<module>` node — so impact/callers answers cover config edits, mapped json files
  carry staleness stamps (edits and deletions get flagged), and the pre-edit hook cards
  `.json` edits with the in-repo importer list. File-level by design: json content is never
  parsed — no symbols, no grammar in the loop, determinism untouched — and an orphan json
  file (nothing imports it) never becomes a node, so lock files add no noise. Scan-cache
  format bumps to v18 (one cold re-extract per workspace on upgrade).

### Added
- **The after-edit gate loop is completable by any MCP client (AC-9).** `codeweb_refresh`
  gains `snapshot:true` (also `refresh.mjs --snapshot`): the pre-refresh graph is preserved as
  `graph.prev.json`, and `codeweb_diff`'s two arguments are now optional — `after` defaults to
  the discovered graph and `before` defaults to that snapshot — so the prescribed
  refresh-then-diff loop no longer needs the plugin's shell copy step. A missing snapshot gets
  an actionable remedy naming the exact call.
- **`codeweb_dependents` — the 28th tool (AC-10).** The complete "who do I break?" union
  (call + import + inherit + test + ref edges, tagged by kind) was CLI-only; it is now a
  first-class MCP tool derived from the same manifest entry, budgeted with true totals, and
  `codeweb_callers` points at it for the full-union question.
- **Staleness honesty reaches the advisors (AC-11).** Every spawned graph-consuming reply now
  carries the call-time staleness verdict (previously only the orient family was annotated —
  `codeweb_simulate` could pre-flight a refactor from a week-old map with full confidence), and
  the overlap-independent advisors (deadcode, risk, hotspots, break_cycles, reading_order,
  simulate, placement, fitness) joined the auto-refresh set. Overlap-consuming advisors stay
  out by design: refresh drops overlaps, so they get the annotation, never a silent refresh.
- **Agent-fallback maps carry their provenance (AC-12).** The codebase-anatomy skill's
  `meta.engine` stamp (hybrid | tools | read) is now read downstream: the briefing payload and
  the session-start injection caveat agent-extracted maps as unverified, instead of answering
  with deterministic-tier authority.

### Changed
- **Claim values now trace to receipts, mechanically.** `check-consistency` gained
  `auditClaimValues`: the published headline stats (the 74%/44% recall pair, the ~126×
  impact-cost ratio, the "more than N comparisons" floor) are recomputed from their committed
  receipt files and every surface restating a different value fails the build — closing the
  drift class behind charter C6, where a re-run moved a receipt and every surface silently kept
  the old number. Deliberately out of scope: the ±-form deltas (three legitimate values from
  two receipts share one textual form). The requirements companion gained a one-way parity
  check (a YAML-traced AC id must still exist in SPEC.md); the reverse — new ACs needing trace
  records — is a re-baseline, which stays the operator's requirements process.
- **A weekly-vitals workflow is drafted** (`weekly-vitals.yml`): the full gate, prove-red, and
  the bench budget gate on a Monday schedule, so SPEC's kill-criteria tripwires can trip
  between pushes (nothing executed for 18 days straight in August). Merging it is the
  operator's adoption decision, recorded in the file header.
- **The evals floor grew from one product case to four** (MCP initialize, tools/list carries
  the new tool, query --help), release tooling gained CLI smoke tests (`version-sync` no-op on
  an aligned repo; `screenshot` usage-not-stacktrace), `bench:all` now measures the tools/list
  definitions surface (`toolsListBytes` — measured, not gated: the descriptions are P1's
  experimental subject), `trend --json` emits one line (NDJSON-appendable), the impact answer
  states its closure semantics (`call+inherit`; ref/import/test users via dependents), a dead
  bench helper was removed, the graph schema's additive-only versioning stance is recorded in
  the reference, and the extractor's cache-invariant map got its one page
  (`docs/extractor-invariants.md`) — measurement over refactoring, per the hotspot ruling.
- **The distribution trigger's second arm is finally measurable.** The weekly acquisition
  ledger now records `gateReposExternal` (unique external repos referencing the gate Action in
  a workflow file, via public GitHub code search — same no-telemetry ethics as every counter).
  The parked Teams tier's own trigger (">10 external repos on the gate Action") could never be
  observed firing before.
- **The gate Action is stranger-ready.** `codeweb-ref` now really accepts a commit sha (clone
  `--branch` fails on shas — branch/tag keep the shallow clone, shas fall back to
  clone+checkout); a new `history` input persists a small cross-PR metrics ledger via the
  Actions cache and renders the structural trend line in the sticky comment (previously the
  trajectory feature was unreachable by adopters); the docs pin the action and `codeweb-ref`
  to release tags instead of `@main` and show the monorepo matrix pattern. The self-gate
  dogfoods `history`.
- **The gate joined the product loop.** A first map of a repo with `.github/` now prints a
  fourth `next:` line pointing at the CI gate, and every report/demo footer carries a
  "gate your PRs" link — the team-lead doorway existed only in docs before.
- **The Marketplace-publish step is gone (charter non-goal 6).** Publishing auto-triggered
  whenever a `VSCE_PAT` secret existed — a secret must not be able to override a standing
  instruction. The `.vsix` still builds and attaches to every release; the removal is recorded
  in place and pinned by the workflow test.
- **Grammar provenance is machine-verified.** `PROVENANCE.md` records a sha256 per vendored
  wasm and `tests/grammar-provenance.test.mjs` recomputes them (both directions: no digest-less
  wasm, no phantom rows) plus the runtime-pin pairing; the refresh recipe now names the
  `ts-engine.mjs` version stamp, and release prep inventories `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@latest`
  so the recorded Kotlin/Swift/C/C++ blockers resolve the moment upstream ships them.
- **The LSP question is answered on the deciding surfaces** (product page + README): an LSP
  answers one hop on demand in an editor session; codeweb builds one deterministic whole-graph
  artifact agents query over MCP and CI diffs to gate a PR. Capability comparison only — no
  invented numbers.
- **Non-Claude MCP clients get the full loop, documented.** The start page now carries
  per-client registration blocks (Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, plugin-less Claude
  Code) and a paste-ready rules snippet that teaches the before/after edit loop — the ambient
  behavior the Claude plugin's hooks provide, for clients that surface neither hooks nor the
  server's built-in instructions. The README names the loop's entry tools and links both.
- **D4 closed — the last Spring-Cleaning debt item.** `codeweb_risk`'s ranking assembly moved
  into `lib/risk.mjs` (`rankRisk` — one truth for the CLI and a future MCP fast path), and
  `run.mjs`'s banner now reads optimize's `--json` totals instead of scraping its prose (a
  wording tweak used to silently blank the ready/LOC fields; humans keep a rendered headline
  and `CODEWEB_VERBOSE=1` shows the full advisory from `optimize.md`).
- **D1 residue closed.** `reading-order`'s CLI budget default now derives from the tool
  manifest via `budgetOf()` (the 40-vs-20 two-literal pair is gone — the manifest is the one
  truth); `campaign`'s deliberate CLI/MCP budget divergence is documented at the site; and the
  release gate now flags a `TOOL_BEHAVIOR` entry whose manifest spec was removed (dead
  behavior — the reverse already threw at startup).
- **The post-edit hook warns once, on one channel.** The structural warning rides the
  structured `additionalContext` only; stderr is the fallback when that write fails — the same
  warning used to arrive twice.
- **External-review verdicts now record the reviewed commit** (`git rev-parse HEAD` of the
  clone, first line of the verdict) — an adopt/avoid ruling without the commit it judged was a
  claim without a source.

### Fixed
- **C7 truth sweep (2026-08-16 drift audit).** The charter-ruled-fabricated sponsorship cost
  premise still shipped through surfaces the claims gate never read: the report and demo footer
  tooltips, `trend.mjs`'s five-snapshot rail, and the FUNDING.yml comment. All now carry the
  ratified support framing, single-sourced from `product-copy.mjs` (`SPONSOR_LINE`), and the
  gate closes the class — the cost-premise scan now sweeps every prose surface plus
  FUNDING.yml, trend, and the gate comment; the generated artifacts (report template, live
  demo) and the remaining site pages joined `PROSE_FILES`; and a numeric public claim hardcoded
  in any script outside `product-copy.mjs` fails the build. Also corrected in the same sweep:
  the README's 126× claim is attributed to the simulated grep loop its receipt actually
  describes, the 74%/44% line carries its v0.9.0-pilot qualifier, the research page dates its
  frozen receipts, the downloads page footer no longer claims "zero third-party requests" while
  reading the public npm API, the README banner alt carries the ratified job line, and four
  stale doc facts were fixed (two `cli.md` env rows, the `reference.md` extractor language
  note, and the AST decision-record header).
- The social-preview source is now a center-safe 1280×640 JPEG. Important copy remains visible
  in narrow mobile crops, and the generated site publishes matching JPEG Open Graph metadata.
- The npm downloads dashboard now starts at the package's actual first publication date
  (2026-07-19), excludes the newest three incomplete UTC days, identifies its cutoff, and calls
  downloads package retrievals instead of users.
- The mcp-registry workflow now chains off the release workflow via `workflow_run` (gated on
  success) — its previous `release: published` trigger could never fire, because events created
  with `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't trigger workflows. codeweb's first registry listing
  (`io.github.GhostlyGawd/codeweb`, v0.12.0) was published by manual dispatch; future releases
  republish automatically.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- **MCP-registry publishing is automated** (`.github/workflows/mcp-registry.yml`): every
  published release now submits `server.json` to registry.modelcontextprotocol.io via GitHub
  Actions OIDC — no browser login, no stored secret. The server name and the npm package's new
  `mcpName` field carry the canonical `io.github.GhostlyGawd/codeweb` identity (casing matched
  to the namespace's existing registry listings); this release is the first whose npm tarball
  ships the `mcpName` ownership handshake the registry requires.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- **A terminal-editorial redesign of the whole site** (owner-approved mock). Near-black paper,
  JetBrains Mono everywhere, a Doto dot-matrix wordmark and numerals, square corners, film
  grain, viewfinder frame — and one accent, spent only on meaning. The homepage opens on the
  live axios map with `merge()` pre-selected and its 56-function blast radius lit in
  chartreuse; the map itself went dithered (pixel-square nodes, stippled edges, HUD crosshairs).
  Benchmark stats render as pixel-block meters (grep 44% vs codeweb 74%). Fonts are
  self-hosted, same-origin; the social-preview card matches.
- **The report UI itself is redesigned to the same system.** Domain bubbles became dithered
  square blocks with their symbol count set inside; edges are straight stippled strokes with an
  accent "blast" state, so a selection's impact reads at a glance; the selected node wears the
  accent with a viewfinder frame. The masthead is a mono-caps HUD (pixel glyph, boxed tabs,
  square search and buttons), findings badges are monochrome (accent = high-confidence only),
  and every place a hue used to carry data — domain slots, matrix cells, treemap density — now
  uses a luminance ramp, which survives every kind of color-vision deficiency by construction.
  Dark is the default; light is an explicit paper mode and `auto` follows the OS. Labels get a
  deterministic screen-space collision cull, so dense graphs stop rendering as label mush.
- **A README banner in the brand language** (`assets/brand/banner.png`): Doto wordmark, pixel
  glyph, caps tagline, and a dithered mini-map with one accent-selected node. The pipeline
  SVGs (`demo.svg`, `pipeline.svg`) and the homepage stage illustrations are redrawn in the
  same square/stipple/single-accent language.
- **An unlisted npm-downloads dashboard** at `/downloads.html`: daily download counts of
  `@ghostlygawd/codeweb` over time, fetched client-side from npm's public API and drawn as a
  dependency-free SVG. Built with the site but excluded from the sitemap and linked from nowhere.

### Changed
- **One ratified identity, on every surface** (`CHARTER.md`, new at the repo root, with a
  `CLAUDE.md` pointer so agents read it first). The job line — "Your agents break less code
  and burn fewer tokens." — now leads the README, the site homepage, tagline, and og titles,
  and the npm / plugin / marketplace / MCP-registry / GitHub-About listings; `check-consistency`
  reads the line from the charter and fails any of those surfaces if it drifts. External review
  is billed as a feature note, not a second mode. The support copy drops the "AI bills from
  benchmarking" story, ruled fabricated in the charter's interview (C7): sponsoring supports
  the project and sponsors get featured README/site placement, and the enterprise offer
  softens to an email doorway — no price, no SLA claim. `docs/ROADMAP.md` is rewritten to the
  charter's Now/Next/Not-now with dated corrections, and the two strategy documents carrying
  the fabricated cost premise now open with correction banners.
- **The funnel leads with the trial.** A "Try it on your repo" section (the npx one-liner) sits
  directly under the README hero, and the homepage hero carries the same command — seeing your
  own repo mapped is the pitch. The axios case study is demoted from a bold callout to a plain
  link under the screenshots. The README masthead drops the hero graphic and the decorative
  engine/MCP/sponsor badges: a text wordmark, the tagline, and three badges (CI, npm, license).
- **Every screenshot and the live demo now show the redesigned report.** The demo is the same
  committed axios graph re-rendered through the new template (274 product symbols, 8 domains),
  the five README/site screenshots are re-shot from it, the blast-radius caption now states
  what the committed graph actually contains (27 call edges into `AxiosError` — the old "58
  users" figure doesn't match this artifact), and the injected demo nav matches the HUD
  (caps, square, no pills).
- **Plain-language pass over the whole marketing funnel.** The README, homepage, and plugin
  listing now state what codeweb is instead of performing the problem — the rhetorical-question
  opener and "Today…" windup are gone, and the proof bullets carry spec-sheet labels
  (Correctness / Duplication / Speed at scale / Agent lift / Limits). Study apparatus left the
  pitch too: the hero's grep-vs-codeweb benchmark table, the "referee"/"oracle" framing, and
  the outbound vite/axios repo links are gone or moved behind the evidence ledger — the pitch
  says what you get; the research page says how it was measured. The proof section is now
  "Benchmarks": benefit-first bullets (callers found 44%→74%, impact answers at 1/126th the
  tokens, renamed-duplicate detection text search can't do) with no meta-talk about our own
  rigor — the 32/33 pre-registration story lives on the research page. Engineering properties
  left the marquee: the DETERMINISTIC · READ-ONLY · ZERO-DEPENDENCY strip is gone from the hero
  (README and hero.svg), and the plugin/marketplace listings say "27 MCP tools" — read-only and
  zero-dep stay where the worry arises, in install and trust copy. Shorter sentences,
  stats stated as outcomes ("+0.31 recall" now reads "with grep agents found 44% of a
  function's callers; with codeweb, 74%. Your agents break code they don't see"), and the
  MCP tool list regrouped by when agents meet each tool (which also
  surfaces `codeweb_explain`, previously undocumented in the README). Density is now gated:
  marketing paragraphs cap at ~55 words, enforced by `tests/copy-density.test.mjs`, with the
  voice rules recorded in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. And the README is a landing page again: its
  reference half — outputs, per-tool docs, the capability table, the full MCP tool groups, the
  component tree — moved to `docs/reference.md`, linked per-job from the README (which drops
  from ~650 to ~330 lines). Two overclaims corrected:
  the homepage no longer calls 16k+ graphs "measured green" (the expand-all receipt says
  `green:false` at that scale), and the pre-registration page no longer says the full study
  re-runs in CI (CI re-measures the standing budgets; the study re-runs via `bench/run-all.mjs`).
  The stale "286-test suite" figure is dropped or time-qualified everywhere it appeared.
- **The regression gate is ONE verdict with a declared strictness knob.** `gateVerdict` (graph-ops)
  now backs diff/CI, simulate, the post-edit hook, codemod, and `review --gate`; payloads carry
  `verdict.check` (`orphan-gate` vs `call-caller-preflight`), exported symbols that lost every
  in-edge are LISTED and flagged exempt instead of silently dropped, and every doc states the real
  rule. simulate/codemod speak for their own check instead of borrowing the gate's.
- **`run.mjs` joins the fleet's stream contract**: results (the done block, or the new `--json`
  one-liner) on stdout, progress on stderr; wrong-path targets exit 2, not the stage-failure code.
- **`codeweb_context`: `bodies: "windows"|"full"` replaces `full`'s second meaning** — `full` is
  the unabridged-list switch only. Agents wanting whole caller bodies pass `bodies:"full"`.
- **One pagination dialect over MCP**: `offset` honored on risk/hotspots/break_cycles,
  `nextOffset` beside every `remaining`, reading_order surfaces its truncation, and the MCP layer
  now rejects unknown argument names and non-boolean booleans the way the CLI always did.
- The shared parser coaches: did-you-mean on unknown flags, `--flag=value` accepted, and the
  no-map cause+remedy is APPENDED to a tool's usage instead of replaced by it.
- One name per concept: "domain" everywhere the report/brief/og said "areas"; deadcode's heading
  hedges up front and shows the `annotate --suppress` door; "blast radius" defined at the lens,
  settings, and optimize surfaces.

### Fixed
- **`find_similar.count` is the true match total again** (it reported the capped length), with
  `more.remaining` when capped.
- Three product-page tool cards rendered the literal word "undefined" (data key drift); the site
  build now fails on a desc-less tool.
- The CI gate action stamped "structural regressions" over setup failures — exit 2 now names the
  shallow-checkout cause and remedy, ci-gate forwards the child's stderr tail, and the quickstart
  bins exit 2 (never the regression code) on old Node.
- `codeweb_map` failures keep the extractor's escapes-first explanation instead of a beheaded
  stderr tail recommending a flag the tool cannot pass.
- The pre-edit hook no longer returns `permissionDecision: "allow"` — it is advisory context only.
- The SessionStart hook says one line (once per workspace) on an unmapped repo with source,
  instead of the silence that read as "the plugin doesn't work".
- annotate refuses to invent a fresh `.codeweb/` in an unmapped cwd; refresh/fitness/placement/
  codemod resolve graphs through the one loader.
- Docs that lied outside the consistency sweep (README's gitignored "bundled sample", agent-tools'
  stale tool count, tests/README's Node floor, the runbook's test count, marketplace.json's
  version) — corrected and swept from now on; new `docs/cli.md` tables every bin, flag,
  environment variable, and exit code; new `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `site/data/product.json`'s (currently unrendered) `elevator` still said "24 deterministic MCP
  query tools" — corrected to 27, and `check-consistency` now scans every prose string in the
  site data file so this class self-catches.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- **The last hand-rolled CLI flag loops now route through the shared `parseArgs(spec)` (lib/cli.mjs),
  so every front door enforces the one #24 unknown-flag policy — reject with usage, exit 2, never a
  silent positional.** `explain.mjs` and `diff.mjs` were the live bug: a no-else `for (const t of
  argv) { if (t === '--json') … else if (!t.startsWith('-')) pos.push(t) }` swallowed a typo instead
  of erroring, so `explain g.json sym --jsno` exited **0** as if the run were clean; both now exit
  **2** with `unknown flag: --jsno` and the usage. `brief.mjs`/`coverage.mjs`/`stats.mjs` already
  `die`d on an unknown flag but still hand-rolled the loop (now one spec apiece), and
  `bench-ts-engine.mjs` swallowed an unknown flag into its target positional — a stray `--engine`
  became the path (exit 1 "target not found"), the original #24 shape — now exit **2** with usage.
  Accepted flags, positionals, and `--help` (exit 0) are preserved exactly;
  `tests/cli-unknown-flags.test.mjs` pins the failing→passing exit codes and the surviving legit
  surface. (round 2, finding #39)
- **The post-edit structural-regression hook now extracts IN-PROCESS instead of spawning a child
  node process — the last residual term of the hook fast-path floor.** Enabled by #40 making
  `extract-symbols` importable with a side-effect-free import, the hook lazily
  `import()`s `runExtract` (after the inert-fire guard, so a no-op fire still pays nothing) and calls
  it directly, killing the child node boot plus the fragment `stringify`(child)+`JSON.parse`(hook)
  round-trip across the process boundary. The symbol-set delta/splice against the #18a baseline
  fragment is `runExtract`'s own warm-cache machinery (WS-D's #17 name-delta path) — the hook adds no
  splice or invalidation logic, so the in-process fire runs exactly what IE-EQUIVALENCE proved
  byte-identical. Measured at the 16.8k-symbol class (median-of-5, this box): no-change fire
  **1,089 ms → 698 ms** (the forced-spawn path vs in-process on the same corpus; 0 extractor child
  processes vs 1, strace-verified), under the 700 ms floor and down from #18a's 889 ms row. A
  fail-open crash ladder keeps the guarantee: `CODEWEB_HOOK_INPROC=0` forces the old spawn (the
  rollback lever), and any throw from the lazy import or `runExtract` triggers one spawn fallback,
  bumped as `hookInprocFallbacks` so a silent divergence is ledger-visible. additionalContext is
  byte-identical across both transports (path-parity test). (round 2, finding #18b)
- **The symbol extractor is being decomposed into testable, importable pieces (the tracked residual
  of round-1 #25, now actually being closed).** Stage 1: per-file call/ref/inherit derivation —
  `deriveFileEdges`, the precision gate (alias > same-file > unique-in-package, drop-ambiguous, plus
  the short-name / closure-local / role / rb-php filters) — moved verbatim out of the 1,400-line
  orchestrator into `scripts/lib/edge-derive.mjs` as a `createEdgeDeriver(ctx)` factory
  (import-resolve's proven template: explicit injected context, zero module-global reach-back). The
  free-variable context was re-derived against the *current* engine, not the spec-time table:
  injected `byName`, `pkgOf`, `roleFor` (the #10 ref role-gate), `resolveFileMember`,
  `closureLocalIds` (the WS-D-review magnet fix), `legacyFallback`; `KEYWORDS`/`parseSignature`/
  `isTestFile`/`buildInnermostIndex` are the lib's own pure-module imports; `idFile` (the id→file
  split) is now defined there as one truth and imported back. Edge derivation is now unit-testable
  in-process at function-call speed (`tests/edge-derive.test.mjs`, no spawn) while staying
  byte-identical to the old inline function — proven by IE-EQUIVALENCE at 40 trials and a full
  self-map cold+warm byte-`cmp`. Stage 2: the two remaining global-resolution passes joined the same
  lib as pure functions — `markPublicApi` (the v10 public-API entrypoint walk, now doing no fs: the
  orchestrator injects `readPkg` + the statted `sources` map and applies the returned ids-to-stamp,
  order-safe because the walk never reads `pub`) and `resolveTypedIntents` (Java/C# typed-receiver
  dispatch), which mechanically retires the finding's named shadowing smells (`rel` loop-var vs the
  `rel()` fn, a `files` local vs the global). Stage 3: the orchestrator now exposes
  `runExtract(opts)` and its **import is side-effect-free** — argv parsing, every `process.exit`, and
  the `--out`/stdout writes moved to a `main()` reached only through the repo's proven
  `import.meta.url` guard idiom; the guard-path exits became `ExtractError` throws with
  byte-identical message text (usage / bad-engine / not-found / empty-tree / zero-symbols), which
  `main()` prints and exits on. Run state that was module-global is now `runExtract` locals; the WASM
  parser engines stay memoized process-wide (the load *promise* is single-flighted, so concurrent
  first-calls don't double-init). `import('extract-symbols.mjs')` now parses no argv, writes no
  files, and never exits — the precondition for the in-process hook (#18b) and for running the
  extractor under node:test's concurrent subtests. Stage 4a: the starter trio of spawn→in-process
  test conversions — `incremental-edges` (the IE-EQUIVALENCE property sweep, the suite's dominant
  wall term: its ~330-490 child launches at CI depth become function calls, cutting the test's own
  wall ~4.5×, 12.9 s → 2.85 s at 40 trials — every assertion identical, the `edged N/M` reads moved
  from stderr to the returned banner, the fragment byte-compares to `JSON.stringify(fragment)`, and
  a new IE-INPROC-PARITY spawn keeps the CLI surface pinned byte-for-byte), plus `call-apply-chain`
  and `test-edges` (extractor in-process, their `query.mjs` spawns untouched). Stage 4b: the
  import/edge-precision + language-extraction family (18 more files) went in-process too, clearing
  the plan's bar — **22 extractor-invoking spawn sites retired** (the convertible subset dropped
  80→58), and the dynamic extractor child-process launches during the incremental-edges run drop
  from 116 to 1 at 10 trials (≈382→1 at 40-trial CI depth). Non-extractor spawns (`query.mjs`,
  `context-pack.mjs`) and the CLI-surface owners (`cli-front-door`, `empty-target`) stay spawn-based.
  (round 2, finding #40)
- **"Expand all symbols" no longer freezes the main thread: the force sim now seeds compactly, has a
  real long-range term, and runs in interruptible slices so no single task blows a frame — plus the
  receipt that judges it is measured honestly.** The old anneal packed every symbol onto its area
  bubble (radius-14 hatch) and repelled only within a 3×3 grid neighborhood, so the ONLY way the
  layout could spread was an accidental ±185k-px explosion whose first step was one ~1.2s synchronous
  task at 16.8k. Now symbols seed on a golden-spiral phyllotaxis hatch (near-equilibrium spacing), a
  Barnes-Hut-lite **far-field monopole** (per-cell mass + center of mass, pushing every node from each
  non-adjacent cell, with a 2×CUT coarsening latch when live cells exceed 4096) gives repulsion its
  missing long-range term, and `gStep` became **`gStepChunk(deadline)`** — a cursor-driven state
  machine that accumulates forces across slices with the grid/aggregate snapshot frozen per logical
  step and exactly ONE integrate + alpha-decay per completed step, so slicing changes only WHEN work
  runs, never the arithmetic (bitwise-equal to a whole-step run — pinned in the lab). `gTick` and the
  reduced-motion loop drive it against their budgets; motion-safe settles now redraw at most once per
  second as discrete progress stills. The result at 16.8k (node sim lab, `bench/experiments/report-sim-lab.mjs`):
  the worst single uninterruptible task drops from **774 ms → 93 ms** (≤ the 250 ms no-freeze floor) and
  the ±185k spread compacts to ~230k px, while the per-step settled cost stays ~**270 ms** — the far
  field is O(n·cells) and reaching the ≤50 ms/frame primary target at this scale needs a hierarchical
  tree (a documented **floor**, per the finding's fallback: no task > 250 ms + interactive, not a pass).
  The receipt (`__codewebStage.expandAll`) was rewritten from an unstable 10-frame sample that straddled
  the explosion (508→116→37 ms across back-to-back calls) to a run-to-settle returning
  `{settledMsPerFrame, maxSingleStepMs, totalSettleMs, steps}`, and `report-scale.mjs` gates on both
  `settledMsPerFrame ≤ 50` and `maxSingleStepMs ≤ 250`. Layout stays a pure, bitwise-deterministic
  function of (graph, interaction sequence) — seeded, no `Math.random`, insertion-order iteration.
  (round 2, finding #35)
- **The interactive graph's draw loop got substantially cheaper per frame: theme colors are read once
  per draw, edges stroke in exact style batches, and labels are screen-space-gated and capped.** Every
  labeled node used to call `getComputedStyle` (up to one per symbol — 16.8k reads on a full 16.8k
  draw); `cvColors()` is now hoisted to one call at the top of `gDraw` (theme flips already redraw, so
  it stays in sync). Edges stroked one `beginPath`+`stroke` each (104k strokes at 16.8k); they now
  group into ≤432 exact style buckets keyed `state|bubble-pair|min(weight,72)` — alpha saturates at
  weight 29 and width at 72, so the key reproduces the old per-edge stroke/width byte-for-byte (a
  50k-edge property test asserts equality), and each bucket strokes once. Labels used a world-space
  radius gate (`nd.r > 7.5`, so a big node lost its label when zoomed out) with no cap; they now use a
  screen-space gate (`nd.r * cam.k > 7.5`) and a per-frame cap of 300, picked by a position-independent
  rank (bubbles > selection/search hits > screen radius, tie-break by id) so they never flicker across
  anneal frames. The search highlight set is computed once in `refreshHits` (stored id/domain Sets) and
  reused by `gDraw` instead of rescanning the active node set every frame. `__codewebStage.drawOnce()`
  times one full draw; `report-scale.mjs` measures it, judges it (`drawOnceOk`, <100 ms), and launches
  Chromium with `chromiumSandbox:false` when running as root. The draw helpers ship as pure functions,
  node-tested via the template-extraction pattern. (round 2, finding #37)
- **The editor CodeLens recomputes far less on every save: blast radius uses the canonical
  pointer-queue walk, the blast memo now persists across graph refreshes, and the extension only
  activates in workspaces that actually hold a codeweb graph.** `blastOf` (`lens-core.js`) walked the
  BFS frontier with `queue.shift()` — O(frontier) per pop, the same O(n²) cliff `graph-ops`'s
  `impactCountOf` already fixed (19.9s→0.3s on a 240k closure) — and rebuilt a `[...callIn, ...inheritIn]`
  array on every visit; it now mirrors `impactCountOf` exactly (index-pointer queue, direct Set
  iteration), with byte-identical results (verified: hub blast 17600 = 17600). `buildLensIndex(graph,
  prevIndex)` carries every memo entry whose blast provably cannot have moved — the invalid set is the
  forward closure of the call/inherit edge delta's `to` endpoints over the new graph — so a save that
  touches a few edges no longer reruns every symbol's transitive closure (`refresh()` stopped clearing
  the cache; a full-file pass is warm-0.23 ms vs cold-hundreds-of-ms on a dense graph). `package.json`
  `activationEvents` moved from `onStartupFinished` (every window) to `workspaceContains:**/.codeweb/
  graph.json` plus the two commands as an explicit palette fallback. Property test: for randomized
  graph pairs mutating 1–5 edges AND adding/removing nodes with their edges, the carried index returns
  the same blast as a cold rebuild for every id; a counting test proves untouched ids are reused, not
  recomputed. (round 2, finding #38)
- **`report.html` no longer embeds the four per-node fields and the per-edge field the template never
  reads.** The self-contained report inlines the graph into a `<script id="graph-data">` payload the
  browser parses on load, but `report-template.html`'s read-set is `id,label,domain,kind,role,file,
  line,loc,exports,summary` per node and `from,to,weight` per edge (grep-verified: node `kind` is read
  at :248/:269/:424/:427, `o.kind` is OVERLAP kind, and edge `kind` / node `t3,signature,complexity,
  maxDepth` are never read). The embed now strips `t3,signature,complexity,maxDepth` per node and `kind`
  per edge into **fresh** objects — `graph` is never mutated, so `graph.json` on disk and the map-time
  sidecars keep every field for the editor lens, the MCP query tools, and the hooks (the strip is
  embed-only). On the 16.8k loaded corpus (AST tier, tree-sitter present) this drops `report.html`
  from 13.88 MB to 9.97 MB (−28.2%): ~4.1 MB stripped = ~1.2 MB `t3` (present on 13.4k/17.6k nodes,
  short fns so avg 7.5 stmt-hashes) + ~2.9 MB `signature/complexity/maxDepth/edge-kind`. On
  statement-heavy code the per-function `t3` fingerprints (arrays emitted for ≥6-statement bodies) grow
  and dominate — codeweb's own `scripts/` (avg t3 len 18) strips 32.8% of the embed; the ≥40% target
  assumed such corpora. The dead `domSummary` builder (`report-template.html:228`, zero readers) is
  deleted. `report.html` stays byte-deterministic across rebuilds (verified: two independent rebuilds
  of the 16.8k report are byte-identical). (round 2, finding #36)
- **The prescribed per-edit loop is now in-process: `codeweb_diff` serves from the cached graph and
  `codeweb_stats` no longer spawns a child.** `codeweb_diff` booted node and parsed **two** graphs per
  call (131–136 ms at 1.2k; ~500 ms at 16k) in the refresh→diff sequence the INSTRUCTIONS prescribe per
  edit; `codeweb_stats` spawned a child (92–95 ms) to read a ~200-byte `stats.json` the server already
  had the reader for. diff's comparison + #28 rename detection are lifted verbatim into a new
  `scripts/lib/diff-core.mjs` (`diffGraphs(before, after, {names, bIx?, aIx?}) → {payload, code}`);
  `diff.mjs` becomes load → diffGraphs → emit (exit codes and `--json`/text bytes unchanged, asserted).
  The MCP fast path parses the caller's before snapshot fresh (never inserted into the graph cache —
  its FIFO eviction would drop the hot live graph), reads the after side from `cachedGraph` (re-stat +
  reload on change), and — I6 — awaits the after-workspace writer tail first, so a concurrent refresh
  lands before the diff reads (it does not reopen #30) and a cancel while it awaits suppresses the
  reply; any throw falls back to the spawned `diff.mjs`, whose stderr becomes the errResult (never
  invented text). `codeweb_stats` mirrors the brief fast path via a new `receiptPayload` in
  `lib/stats.mjs` (the one place the empty-note literal lives; `stats.mjs --json` serves it too).
  Byte-for-byte parity with both CLIs is asserted (MD1/MD2/MD2b for diff; empty + non-empty ledgers
  for stats; missing-graph errResult identical to the spawn path). After this, refresh is the loop's
  only child. (round 2, finding #33)
- **Read-only MCP tools on one workspace now run concurrently (reader/writer queue split).** Stage 1
  of the queue redesign kept full per-workspace serialization; the 12+ read-only spawned tools
  inherited write-ordering they don't need, so behind one slow advisor every other spawned tool on
  that graph queued (hotspots-behind-risk measured ≈ risk+hotspots, the head-of-line shape prior-#19
  fixed only for the in-process fast paths). Tools are now classified writer vs reader: writers keep
  the FIFO chain (I1) and additionally wait for readers enqueued before them (I3, the conservative
  rule — a spawned reader makes multiple workspace reads and a writer landing mid-read would hand it a
  torn state, so today's linearization is preserved); readers order after any earlier-queued writer
  (I2) then run under a global cap of 3 concurrent children (I4, FIFO waiters). Measured: risk solo
  152 ms, hotspots solo 149 ms, the two concurrent **146 ms** (≈ max, not the ~301 ms sum) at 445
  symbols. `READER_CAP=1` restores full serialization (the rollback lever). The aggressive
  "writers skip readers" variant was reviewed and rejected (torn multi-artifact reads). Scenarios
  **S6** (reader overlap), the cap test (never 4 concurrent), and the writer-barrier test
  (`end(reader₁) ≤ start(writer) < start(reader₂)`) pin I2/I3/I4 by mechanism. (round 2, finding #32)

### Fixed
- **`codeweb_refresh` now regenerates the sidecar trio, so the hook / find_similar fast paths keep
  their floor for the whole session.** `refresh.mjs` rewrote `graph.json` but never touched
  `brief.json`, `index-lite.json`, or `similar-index.json` — and all three stamp on graph mtime+size,
  so one refresh invalidated every one until the next full map (measured: session-brief 63–70 →
  106–127 ms, pre-edit 73–81 → 98–135 ms, `find_similar --body` 605 → 1,104 ms). Since the server's
  INSTRUCTIONS prescribe `codeweb_refresh` after every edit, every real session lost the floor within
  minutes and never got it back. The map-time sidecar writer is now ONE lib (`scripts/lib/sidecars.mjs`,
  `writeSidecars`): `build-report.mjs` calls it (byte-identical outputs to the old inline block,
  asserted) and refresh calls it after its atomic graph write. brief + index-lite are pure functions of
  the graph and are always rewritten; similar-index is rebuilt when `meta.root` is readable (via the
  current v2 capped-shingle builder — closing the #26 dup-check-pool staleness that also depended on
  this) and otherwise REMOVED so a stale one is never silently served. All three share ONE stat stamp
  and are written strictly after the graph rename, so a crash between the two leaves only stamp-
  mismatched sidecars (every loader falls back to null → the live path) — a fresh-stamped-wrong-content
  sidecar is impossible by ordering. Coexists with WS-D's `hook-baseline.json` (write order: graph →
  hook-baseline → trio). Scenario **S5** asserts freshness by MECHANISM (stamps match statSync, not
  wall-clock). (round 2, finding #25)
- **MCP cancellation is honored, and malformed / batch JSON-RPC frames get a real answer instead of a
  silent hang.** `handle()` dropped every id-less message, so `notifications/cancelled` was ignored —
  a wrong `codeweb_map` burned up to 300s unstoppable and still replied. Non-object frames (`42`,
  `"x"`, `null`) and JSON-RPC batch arrays destructured to `id === undefined` and were dropped with no
  response, so a conforming `2024-11-05`/`2025-03-26` client that sent a batch hung forever. Now: an
  id→child map (owned by `runChild`) lets `notifications/cancelled` SIGKILL the in-flight child (or
  mark a still-queued job so it never spawns) and suppress its reply while still releasing the queue
  slot / drain counter; a non-object frame answers `-32600` Invalid Request; a batch array is handled
  by minimal per-member fan-out — each member is processed as if it arrived alone and its response is
  emitted as its own NDJSON line (an empty array is a single `-32600`). Line-framed rather than
  array-collected responses is a documented, adjudicated tradeoff (a collector would deadlock on a
  cancel-suppressed member, which gets no response); every by-id-correlating client — every driver in
  this repo — is unaffected. Scenarios **S4** (cancel kills the child, no reply, ping still answers)
  and **S7** (malformed + batch frames) pin it. (round 2, finding #34)
- **The MCP queue is now keyed by WORKSPACE DIRECTORY, so refresh→diff ordering actually holds (and
  map/autoRefresh joined the queue).** The per-workspace serialization the queue comment promised did
  not hold: `codeweb_diff` is `graphless`, so it queued under a shared `'(graphless)'` slot while
  `codeweb_refresh` queued under the graph *file* path — fired together (which Claude Code does
  routinely, and the server's own INSTRUCTIONS prescribe per edit), diff completed *before* refresh
  and gated against pre-refresh bytes (can pass a real regression or flag a phantom one). Two other
  spawn sites bypassed the queue entirely: `codeweb_map` and the internal auto-refresh ran outside it,
  so two maps on one out dir interleaved stage-by-stage and an auto-refresh could race an explicit
  refresh into two concurrent extracts on one scan cache. Redesigned as ONE per-workspace-directory
  queue (`dirname(resolve(graph.json))` for graph tools, `resolve(out)` for map, `dirname(after)` for
  diff via a new `queueFrom`) with a single `runChild` wrapper owning spawn/timeout/settle-once/trace
  for every child. `handleMap` gains the settle-once guard it never had (a spawn failure there used to
  double-reply and double-decrement the drain counter — now exactly one reply, verified). Auto-refresh
  skips when the workspace already has a writer queued/in-flight (`writersPending`, read race-free in
  the same readline drain) and otherwise enqueues as a writer. Stage 1 preserves full per-workspace
  serialization; reader concurrency lands separately (#32). Opt-in `CODEWEB_MCP_TRACE=1` emits an
  NDJSON queue-event stream on stderr (default silent) for the by-mechanism scenario suite (S2/S3/I7).
  (round 2, findings #30 #31)
- **A dying child no longer crashes the whole MCP server (unhandled EPIPE on child stdin).**
  `codeweb_find_similar` is the one tool that writes to a child's stdin (the candidate `body`); when
  the body exceeded the 64KB pipe buffer and the child exited before draining it (bad graph path,
  arg-validation `die(2)`, the 120s SIGKILL), the flush raised EPIPE with no `'error'` listener and
  **Node killed the server** — every tool dead, the request unanswered (repro'd: 1 MB body + bad
  graph → exit 1 at ~241ms). The async conversion introduced it; the pre-conversion `spawnSync({input})`
  had contained it. Fixed by attaching `child.stdin.on('error', …)` before writing and wrapping
  `stdin.end()` in try/catch (covering the async EPIPE, the synchronous `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED`, and a
  null `stdin` after spawn failure). The failed call is now a normal `isError` result and a subsequent
  request answers. The server's *own* stdout was never at risk — it inherits `lib/cli.mjs`'s
  `process.stdout` EPIPE→exit(0) handler via an import side effect (a duplicate listener would be dead
  code); scenario **S1** pins both halves (child-stdin EPIPE and client-closes-stdout). Also dropped
  the dead `spawnSync` import left by the async conversion. (round 2, finding #29)
- **`break-cycles.mjs` and `diff.mjs` are searchable again (raw NUL bytes removed).** Both
  product files embedded literal NUL bytes as template-literal key separators, so `file`, `grep`,
  and ripgrep classified them as binary — invisible to every code search (three separate audits
  hit it this round, and one edit to break-cycles left it binary). The four raw bytes are now
  the `'\x00'` escape (the graph-ops/extract-symbols idiom — same runtime string, so break-cycles
  and diff output stays byte-identical, verified against the pre-fix binaries on a cyclic
  fixture in both `--json` and text mode). A new lint tripwire, `tests/no-control-bytes.test.mjs`,
  fails naming any tracked `.mjs` file containing a raw byte below 0x09 (`\t`/`\n`/`\r`
  unaffected), so the class stays closed. (round 2, finding #41)
- **Retargeting a re-export barrel no longer leaves stale call edges in warm extracts.** Flipping
  a forward (`export { x } from './a.js'` → `'./b.js'`, or a Python from-import chain) changes
  ZERO symbols, so the shipped engine's wholesale reuse gate (symbol signature + per-file content
  hash) replayed unchanged consumers' cached edges still aimed at the OLD chain target — found by
  #17's extended IE generator (5/40 trials red under the pre-delta engine), reproduced
  deterministically by IE-REX-FLIP, and re-verified red against the workstream-entry tree. Both
  reuse gates (edges and binds) now also require an unchanged re-export landscape (`rexSig`
  canonical-table hash, plus a Python (module, name)-membership belt for edge-time chains).
  Landed inside #17 part 1 (`8582b4f`); recorded here so the truth fix is visible outside the
  perf entry. (round 2, finding #17 — WS-D review note)
- **Bare-name fallback edges can no longer target another file's closure-locals.** The
  unique-in-package fallback resolved a bare name to ANY package-unique symbol — including
  functions nested inside other functions, which no other file can lexically reach. The measured
  magnet was real: graph-ops' `dep` loop variables ref-resolved into import-resolve's private
  `dep` closure and fabricated a graph-ops ↔ import-resolve cycle the structural gate blocked
  (31 such edges existed on the self-map, including the `scanJsReExports → graph-ops:map` half of
  that same cycle). The fallback now filters closure-local targets (positive containment on
  function/method ranges; PHP/Ruby exempt — their nested definitions become reachable at runtime;
  same-file resolution untouched). Nesting is now part of the resolution landscape, so a
  wrap-into-closure edit invalidates consumers: the eligibility bit annotates `symbolSig` and both
  name-delta label maps, pinned by a warm-vs-cold byte-equality test that fails without the
  annotation. Derivation-semantics change ⇒ `SCANNER_VERSION` 16 → 17 (one cold rebuild).
  (round 2, WS-D review — the #10 short-name guard's documented residual, closed at any length)
- **The JS masker now lexes regex literals.** `maskJs` tracked strings/templates/comments but not
  regex literals, so a quote inside the ubiquitous escaping-helper pattern (`replace(/…/g)` with a
  quote in the regex) desynced its string state — bodies ran to EOF, absorbing neighbors and
  fabricating call edges from the absorbed code — and a backtick inside a regex flipped template
  state (an odd count blanked the rest of the file: codeweb's own `lib/complexity.mjs` extracted
  as 5 nodes / 0 edges, and 13 of 25 deadcode "safe" items on the self-map were false positives).
  Regex literals are now recognized with the standard prev-significant-token heuristic (escape-
  and char-class-aware; division and JSX close tags unaffected) and their interiors blanked like
  strings — including inside `${}` interpolations, where a `{2}` quantifier corrupted brace
  matching. The `String.fromCharCode` authoring convention that worked around the blind spot is
  deleted (ts-engine.mjs string regexes, Ruby mask regexes) and now serves as a live self-test;
  `tests/maskjs-regex-literals.test.mjs` pins the two reproduced corruptions plus a self-map
  regression on complexity.mjs. (perf-quality finding 1)
- **`codemod --write` can no longer corrupt source while reporting success.** Three reproduced
  failure modes closed: (a) an unresolvable/ambiguous `--into` is a hard exit 2 instead of being
  used verbatim (pre-fix, `canonLabel` became `undefined`, BOTH definitions were deleted, and loser
  tokens — including a string literal — were rewritten to the literal text `undefined`, with exit 0
  and `applied: true`); (b) token rewrites are now gated on the column-preserving mask — comment
  mentions are left as stale prose and counted, and a label inside a string/regex literal refuses
  the whole write (a name in a value can be load-bearing); (c) imports that named a loser are
  repointed at the canonical's file (pre-fix `import { canon } from './loser.mjs'` survived —
  valid-looking, broken at runtime, invisible to the structural gate), importers-without-calls are
  now part of the rewrite set, and the post-write gate additionally asserts the canonical itself
  survived re-extraction. The maskers moved to `scripts/lib/masking.mjs` (importable — the start of
  finding 25's decomposition) with a `keepValues` mode for the live/value/comment classification.
  (perf-quality finding 2)
- **Workspace artifacts are crash-safe, and the stage memo validates before reusing.** Every
  graph/fragment/sidecar/report writer now goes through `atomicWrite` (same-dir temp + rename —
  readers see old bytes or new bytes, never a truncated half-write; the reproduced kill window was
  the MCP server SIGTERM-ing its refresh child at 60s mid-`writeFileSync`), and `run.mjs`'s stage
  memo refuses to reuse outputs whose graph.json no longer parses (pre-fix, a corrupt workspace
  got "stages reused (fragment unchanged)" forever — the natural recovery path preserved the
  corruption). `tests/atomic-writes.test.mjs` pins both. (perf-quality finding 3)
- **Freshness stamps can no longer be false-fresh.** The extractor stats each file BEFORE reading
  and re-stats after (re-reading on mismatch; a file that won't hold still gets a never-fresh
  stamp) — pre-fix a file modified between read and stat carried a fresh stamp over stale bytes,
  permanently. Stamps now carry the content sha1 (`meta.sources: {s,m,h}`), and `checkStaleness`
  gained a verify tier — `CODEWEB_VERIFY_FRESHNESS=1` (or `{verify:true}`) sha1-compares content
  where stats match, catching the reproduced mtime-preserving bypass (`rsync -a`, `tar -x`,
  `git-restore-mtime`, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` builds) across every consumer: MCP auto-refresh, query
  stale-annotations, hooks. Stat-only stays the default fast path. (perf-quality finding 4)
- **Byte-determinism, delivered.** `generatedAt` was the sole byte-difference between two
  identical runs; the report embed also carried per-file/dir mtime stamps its template never
  reads. report.html now strips `generatedAt`/`sources`/`dirs` alongside `root` (byte-identical
  across runs and across fresh checkouts, no pinning needed), and graph.json honors
  `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so CI can byte-compare complete workspaces. graph.json keeps all three
  fields (brief reads generatedAt; staleness reads the stamps). (perf-quality finding 5)

### Performance
- **Migration leftovers swept, plus a `trend --git` fast path.** Seven small chores from the
  lib-extraction migration: (1) dead `writeFileSync` imports dropped from overlap/build-report/
  coverage/refresh; (2) `coverage.mjs` writes the annotated graph COMPACT (was the last
  pretty-printed graph.json — 20.6 → 13.0 MB); (3) the stranded "THE body reader" jsdoc moved back
  above `sourceReader`; (4) `lib/import-resolve.mjs` re-indented to uniform 2-space (the two verbatim-
  moved blocks were left at column 0 / column 2 — `git diff -w` empty, extract-equivalence suites
  green); (5) `lib/stats.mjs` + `lib/annotations.mjs` writes now go through `atomicWrite` (crash-safe,
  bytes/formatting unchanged, best-effort try/catch preserved); (6) a `staleNote` on
  `bench/results/scale-typescript.json` (v0.9.0 pre-fix; real re-run is WS-G #35). (7) **trend fast
  path:** `run.mjs` gains `--stages through-overlap` (extract + cluster + overlap only; any other
  value exits 2 — no silent typo path; a partial run NEVER writes the stage memo, so a partial
  workspace can't satisfy a later full run's reuse check), and `trend.mjs --git` now reuses ONE
  workspace dir across commits (scan-cache persistence; worktree churn stays per-commit) running each
  commit through-overlap. A reused-ws belt accepts a commit's row only when the loaded
  `graph.meta.target` equals that commit's sha7, so a failed commit's row is never misattributed to a
  stale graph left in the shared workspace. Metrics are byte-identical to the pre-fix full-pipeline
  path; measured on a 2-commit 680-file repo: per-commit ~7.5 → **~4.6 s** (extract-dominated, the
  optimize+report stages skipped). (round 2, finding #42)
- **`diff` rename detection is indexed, memoized, and honest about its cap.** The removed×added
  rename matcher called `graph.nodes.find` twice per candidate pair (an O(nodes) scan inside an
  O(removed×added) loop) and re-shingled every added body once per removed node — 1,733 ms of
  rename-detection overhead on a 14,964-node graph with 195 relabeled nodes. The logic moved into a
  pure, ambient-state-free `detectRenames()` (WS-F #33 lifts it verbatim) that uses the already-built
  `byId` indexes, hoists each old body's skeleton out of the inner loop, and memoizes each new body's
  skeleton once for the whole pass (null bodies memoized too, so an unreadable body is not re-read per
  removed node and still routes to the span-shape fallback). Bodies are capped at `BODY_LINE_CAP` lines
  before shingling like overlap/dup-check — a >400-line rename's similarity can shift to the overlap
  answer BY DESIGN (a >400-line rename still detects; test-covered), while every short-body fixture pin
  stays byte-identical. Detection above `RENAME_CAP` (200) nodes on either side is now surfaced: an
  additive `nodes.renameCheck = { skipped, removed, added, cap }` field plus one text-mode line name
  the skip (absent when both sides fit, and when a side is empty nothing was skippable) — the field is
  documented in diff.mjs's header and breaks neither the graphless MCP `codeweb_diff` passthrough nor
  the graph-ops-based hook gate. Measured min-of-3 at 14,964 nodes: 195-rename overhead 1,733 → **30 ms**;
  `renamed[]` byte-identical to the pre-fix binary (195 pairs). (round 2, finding #28)
- **`campaign` runs its three advisors concurrently and stops cloning the graph it owns.** The
  worklist composer spawned optimize, deadcode, and break-cycles with three BLOCKING `spawnSync`
  calls (wall = sum of the three children), then `planCampaign` `structuredClone`d the whole graph
  defensively. The advisors now run under async `spawn` + `Promise.all` (wall ≈ max child + compose):
  each child's stdout is collected while its stderr is drained and discarded (matching spawnSync's
  collect-and-discard — an undrained stderr pipe deadlocks a child at ~64 KB), the exit code is
  ignored exactly as before, a spawn error or non-JSON stdout degrades to the empty default, and
  `Promise.all`'s array order fixes the composition order so campaign's own stdout is byte-identical
  regardless of which child finishes first. `planCampaign` gains `clone` (default `true`); campaign
  passes `clone:false` because it owns the freshly-parsed graph and `normalizeGraph` is idempotent
  additive default-filling that never touches `meta` (every other caller keeps the safe clone).
  Pinned by CMP-CONCURRENT-STABLE (single-line JSON, byte-stable across runs, `meta.target` survives
  the in-place normalize) and the unchanged CMP-DELTA-EQUIV property. Measured min-of-3 at 14,964 nodes:
  campaign wall 1.65 → **0.89 s**, payload `cmp`-identical to the pre-fix binary. (round 2, finding #27)
- **`dup-check` serves its comparison pool from the map-time similar-index sidecar (no per-call
  re-shingle of the whole repo).** The review/PostToolUse duplication gate re-read and re-shingled
  every non-test function body on every invocation — 374 ms for a single changed symbol at 14,964
  nodes (1,804 ms for 50), a repeated tax inside the agent edit loop. `incrementalOverlap` now takes
  an optional `similarIndex`: pool members with a sidecar record use the stored shingle-set size for
  the exact size-ratio precut BEFORE any read, and survivors intersect by iterating the stored set
  against the live candidate — the integer intersection count makes `round6` sim bit-equal to the
  live Jaccard, so the reported set is byte-identical (verified live == sidecar on 200 corpus ids and
  by the DC-SIDECAR-EQ equivalence test, which includes a CRLF file and a >400-line pool body for
  reader/cap parity). Changed ids always shingle live (their bodies are the new code under judgment);
  a stale/absent sidecar falls back to the live path unchanged. `review.mjs` passes
  `loadSimilarIndex(abs)`. Measured min-of-3 at 14,964 nodes: 1 changed symbol 374 → **6 ms (62×)**;
  50 changed 1,804 → 1,115 ms. **Surfaced behavior change:** `BODY_LINE_CAP` (400) is now one exported
  const in `lib/shingles.mjs` (imported by overlap, dup-check, find-similar, diff, and the sidecar
  builder), and `buildSimilarIndex` + find-similar's live path now cap node bodies to their first 400
  lines like overlap/dup-check always did — so a >400-line body's find-similar ranking changes to the
  overlap/dup-check answer, BY DESIGN. Surfaced three ways: find-similar's JSON payload gains
  `bodyLineCap`, both file headers document it, and the candidate text (`--body`/`--stdin`/
  `--signature`) stays UNCAPPED. The sidecar schema is bumped 1 → 2 (one `SIMILAR_VERSION` const,
  stamped by the builder and checked by the loader) so stale uncapped v1 sidecars are rejected, never
  served. (round 2, finding #26)
- **Overlap's LSH stops paying the singleton-bucket tax (~85% of Signal B).** At 15.7k nodes the
  64-band twin pass built ~1M ~25-char string keys into one map ending at ~950k buckets, 99.3%
  singletons — then sorted and walked all of them, while actual similarity confirmations were
  ~30 ms. Two tiers, each landed behind its own proof: (1) sort/walk only multi-occupancy buckets
  (singletons hit the `< 2` continue before the cap check, so they touch NOTHING — no side
  effects to preserve); (2) numeric band-hash bucketing in the new `lshCandidatePairs`
  (lib/minhash.mjs — one walk for both signals, band-major for map locality): rows fold to a
  uint32, each bucket verifies its first-insert row tuple, true hash collisions spill
  deterministically to a per-band side map keyed by the exact tuple string — grouping stays
  exactly the string-key grouping provably, and legacy string keys are materialized ONLY for
  multi-occupancy groups, so the pair sequence handed to the confirm chain equals the legacy
  global string-sort walk order by construction (order is load-bearing: byLabelPair keeps the
  first twin per label pair at a slice rank where sim ties are routine). Pinned by the
  LSH-PAIRS-EQ property (220 seeded cases deep-equal a verbatim string-key reference — the pairs
  ARRAY pins order; buckets/skippedBuckets asserted) and byte-identical graph.json + overlap.md +
  stdout vs the pre-fix binary on the 15k corpus and the self-map (both tiers separately).
  Measured min-of-3 at 14,964 nodes: Signal-B twin-enumeration mark 2,724 → 1,234 (tier 1) →
  **400 ms (6.8×)**; Signal-C 238 → 118 ms; overlap stage wall 3.37 → 0.93 s. (round 2,
  finding #24)
- **`break-cycles` verifies cuts on the SCC-induced pseudo-graph instead of re-running whole-graph
  Tarjan per candidate.** A dense SCC (no single-pair cut works) tried every candidate, and each
  trial filtered ALL graph edges + recomputed file cycles over the whole graph — 19.5 s (22.8 s on
  the finding's box) for one dense 60-file SCC inside a 93k-edge graph, inherited by campaign
  (20.3 s), and gate-invisible because break-cycles was absent from the bench and the bench corpus
  is acyclic by construction. Verification now runs the SAME `fileCycles` on a per-cycle
  pseudo-graph (one node per file, one edge per surviving in-SCC pair, from a pair-witness table
  counting ALL four cycle kinds — the ref subtlety: candidates stay STRUCTURAL/severable, but a
  pair alive only via `ref` must survive a structural cut). The verdict is exact, not
  approximate — removal only touches in-SCC pairs and an outside router would itself have been in
  the SCC — pinned by a 150-case seeded property (all four kinds, duplicate edges, ref-closed
  cycles) deep-equal against a frozen whole-graph oracle, plus the CB-REF-ALIVE scenario (a
  STRUCTURAL-only witness table goes red there — mutation-checked during the build). The cut
  logic moved to `graph-ops.cheapestCuts` behind a byte-identity pin (json + text, fixture +
  cyclic corpus), and `CYCLE_KINDS` is now one exported truth for fileCycles, the merge
  simulator, and the witness table. Measured min-of-3: embedded dense SCC 19.5 s → **0.35 s**;
  campaign on the same graph 20.3 s → 1.58 s; payloads byte-identical. `bench/all.mjs` gains a
  `breakCycles` advisor row plus a `cyclic` section over a new pinned dense-SCC corpus
  (`writeCyclicCorpus`: double-ring construction makes "no single-pair cut breaks it" guaranteed),
  factor-gated so the whole-graph re-verify class can never ship unseen again. (round 2,
  finding #23)
- **`reading-order` answers at the budget instead of ordering the whole graph first.** The greedy
  "fewest unemitted callees" loop recounted every remaining node's unemitted callees per emitted
  item and applied the budget only after the COMPLETE order existed — 48.8 s (75.9 s on the
  finding's box) for the default 40-item answer at a 15k-node corpus, on track to hit the MCP
  server's 120 s spawn timeout at 30k. The greedy choice depends only on the emitted set, so the
  loop now exits at the budget with live unemitted-callee counters (decremented through a
  reverse-caller map; self-call edges keep their own +1 until emission), swap-pop removal, and an
  index-pointer queue in the symbol-scope closure — first-N byte-identical to the full order's
  prefix, pinned by a 200-case seeded property against a frozen copy of the old implementation
  (all three scope kinds, self-calls and cycles included) plus `cmp` against the pre-fix binary at
  budget 40 AND full order on the 15k corpus. Budget normalization is pinned at the lib boundary
  (finite budgets truncate like the old slice; NaN/±Infinity mean full order). Measured min-of-3:
  48.8 s → **0.37 s** at budget 40 (full order 6.4 s). `bench/all.mjs` gains a `readingOrder`
  advisor row + `readingOrderMs` on the loaded corpus, budget-gated at 0.5× the regex-extract
  baseline, so this can never regress invisibly again. (round 2, finding #22)
- **The post-edit hook stops re-verifying an unchanged baseline (hook-baseline sidecar).** On
  every edit the hook JSON.parsed the multi-MB baseline graph and recomputed its file cycles and
  caller index — map-time artifacts that cannot have changed since map time. `run.mjs` (after
  the stage run; on the reuse path only when missing/stale) and `refresh.mjs` (from the JSON
  string it just wrote — free) now persist `hook-baseline.json` beside graph.json: version,
  graph stamp (size + mtime) + byte sha1, cycle keys, and caller counts, via the new
  `baselineSummary`/`regressionsAgainstSummary` split in graph-ops (`structuralRegressions` is
  their composition — one truth, existing callers untouched). The hook consumes it when the
  stamp — or, on stamp mismatch, the hash (identical-bytes rewrites re-validate; the bytes read
  are shared with the fallback parse, one read) — matches, and falls back to today's path
  otherwise. Fail-open at every seam, pinned by five BDD scenarios including the
  poisoned-sidecar proof (a baseline cycle key removed from the sidecar is reported as new —
  only the sidecar could say that) and both-corrupt silent-exit-0. Both write points are
  best-effort try/catch. Measured min-of-3 at the 16.8k corpus: no-change hook fire 1,167 →
  889 ms (the < 1.5 s floor holds with margin); the in-process-extraction residual is #18b,
  deferred to WS-H and pointed to from hook-fastpath-floor.md's revisit triggers. (round 2,
  finding #18a)
- **Adding one function no longer re-derives the whole repo (name-delta invalidation).** A
  symbol-set change used to fail the edge/binding caches for EVERY file — the canonical agent
  edit (add a function) cost a full re-read + re-mask + re-derive (2.1× the no-change floor
  measured at the 16.8k-symbol corpus). The caches now compute the NAME DELTA — labels whose
  sorted definition-id lists differ between the cached and live symbol tables — and re-derive
  only files that could see it: a file's cached edges replay iff its content hash is unchanged,
  its candidate-name set (every identifier reaching the edge resolver, recorded pre-resolution)
  is disjoint from the delta, and its import BINDING replayed (the hardening conjunct: aliased
  imports and namespace member calls ride the bind rule — original imported names plus a
  content-hash check over every file the bind consulted, re-export walks and dead ends
  included). Wholesale transitions stay wholesale: package-boundary changes, file add/delete,
  re-export-landscape moves (rexSig, with a Python (module, name)-membership belt for edge-time
  chains), rules changes, migration, `--full`/verify mode — and the kill-switch
  `CODEWEB_NAME_DELTA=0` restores the old wholesale mechanism outright (identical bytes, only
  wall-time moves). Proven by the extended IE-EQUIVALENCE property harness at full CI depth (40
  trials, both env legs) with warm-vs-cold fragment BYTE equality at every mutation step, plus
  new incrementality assertions: add-one-function re-edges only the edited file + its
  bind-coupled importer while a crafted disjoint file replays; a def rename of an imported name
  re-edges the importer. Measured min-of-3 at 16.8k: add-one-function 1,326 → 710 ms — 1.27× the
  same-session noop floor (bar ≤ ~1.3×, was 2.12×); body-edit unchanged (771 → 759 ms); delete
  1,279 → 703 ms; rename 1,329 → 708 ms; the colliding-name add (a name every file calls) stays
  honestly near-wholesale at 1,127 ms. at 29.4k: add-one-function 2,294 → 1,277 ms (1.22× noop,
  was 2.14×). Hook add-one-function end-to-end 1,909 → 1,027 ms. (round 2, finding #17)
- **The warm no-change floor sheds its four avoidable terms.** (a) The scan cache no longer
  stores `syms` (symbols sat in it three times over) and interns per-file edges as an id table +
  `[from,to,kind]` triples instead of verbose objects — the edge term shrank 57 %, the whole
  cache 32–38 % depending on engine tier (measured 18.9 → 12.8 MB at the 16.8k-symbol bench
  corpus; the spec's ≥ 40 % estimate assumed `syms` was a full third of the symbol bytes — the
  measured decomposition shows 6 %, with `nodes` dominating). A content-hash hit now replays the
  FULL cached product set (nodes/ranges/dyn/ast/typed intents, entry carried forward with a
  refreshed stamp) instead of rebuilding nodes from cached syms, gated on rulesSig like the stamp
  tier. Cache format change ⇒ SCANNER_VERSION 15 → 16 (the WS-B/C/D ladder); any older cache is
  discarded for one cold rebuild — pinned by a planted-poison migration test proving byte-equal
  output to no-cache. (b) `--out` fragments are written compact (22.7 → 14.2 MB at 16.8k; every
  reader JSON.parses) and an unchanged fragment is never rewritten — size + sha1 equality skips
  the write and the banner says `(unchanged)`. (c) `run.mjs`'s stage memo now records
  `{size, sha1}` per output and validates all five before reuse (size first, so truncation never
  hashes) — replacing the old graph.json-only full-parse belt (330 ms at 13.9 MB) with a 36 ms
  read-back that also catches parseable byte-tampering and guards the four outputs that had no
  belt at all (new S5/S6 scenarios); `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` joins the memo key so a changed epoch is
  never served stale bytes. Warm no-change pipeline at the 16.8k corpus: 825 → 677 ms min-of-3.
  IE-EQUIVALENCE now additionally asserts warm-vs-cold fragment BYTE equality at every mutation
  step — the shared oracle the name-delta work (#17) reuses. (round 2, finding #19)
- **Per-file edge derivation is no longer quadratic in symbols-per-file.** `enclosing()` linearly
  scanned ALL of a file's ranges on every call-site match (profiled: `addEdge` 50.8 % self on an
  8,000-function file — the monorepo hub-file shape), and the method-owner attribution re-scanned
  ranges-so-far per method. Both are now index lookups: an innermost-range-per-line array built in
  one O(lines + R log R) stack sweep (lookup O(1)), and a live open-class stack across the
  line-sorted build loop (amortized O(1) per method). Behavior-identical by construction and by
  proof: a 300-trial property suite embeds the old linear scans verbatim as oracles — duplicate
  starts, overlaps, degenerate ranges included — and the 8k-fn fixture extract is byte-identical
  before/after in both engine tiers. Measured min-of-3 against the workstream-entry tree: the
  8k-fn single-file extract 1,514 → 734 ms (2.06×) on the regex tier (3,210 → 2,393 ms with the
  AST tier, which is parse-dominated); the 800-file corpus is unchanged-to-faster (1,257 →
  1,162 ms). (round 2, finding #21)
- **`maskJs` lexes ~3–5× faster, byte-identically.** The masker ran a compiled-regex `.test()`
  per character (word-class tracking) plus a one-char string append per character — ~27–30 MB/s
  on real mixes, on the hottest path in the engine (every cold/changed file, and the whole repo
  after any symbol-set change until the name-delta work lands). Two changes, zero byte diffs:
  the word-class test is a charCode range check, and each lexer state now span-copies whole runs
  of plain text up to its next special character (special sets re-derived from the post-WS-B
  state machine and documented in place), folding the run into the significant-char state with
  one backward walk that reproduces the old per-char accumulation exactly. Measured min-of-3:
  26.8 → 135.8 MB/s (5.1×) on the 800-file bench corpus, 30.2 → 95.0 MB/s (3.2×) on this repo's
  own 229 mask-eligible files. Byte-identity is pinned by a committed oracle test that embeds
  the pre-change masker verbatim and compares outputs over every mask-eligible repo file, a
  loaded bench-corpus tree, and adversarial fixtures, in all mode combinations — which is also
  why this ships with NO scanner-version bump. (round 2, finding #20)
- **Tree-sitter parse trees are freed.** web-tree-sitter has no FinalizationRegistry, and none of
  the engine's 8 parse sites called `tree.delete()` — every cold/changed-file extract on a default
  install leaked WASM pages for the process lifetime (measured: 1,312MB vs 217MB peak RSS on an
  11MB corpus; large-file repos risked OOM). All sites now free in `try/finally`; output is
  byte-identical and ~9% faster from reduced GC pressure. A static tripwire test pins parse-site
  count == delete-site count so a new parse can't quietly reintroduce the leak. (perf-quality
  finding 6)
- **The JS/TS AST tier extracts in ONE cursor traversal.** `extractJsTs` walked the full tree
  three times (methods, Type-3 fingerprints, dispatch) via per-child JS↔WASM crossings — profiled
  at 62% of AST extract self-time — and `cyclomaticExact` re-parsed every regex-owned body slice
  from scratch for exact complexity (28%). One TreeCursor pass now collects everything: ancestor
  stacks replace upward parent-walks, dispatch candidates resolve after the walk against the
  complete method tables, and decisions are tallied per start row so a symbol's exact complexity
  is `1 + sum(extent rows)` — the identical decision set the slice re-parse counted, with zero
  re-parses. Verified output-identical on a full corpus (393 nodes, 983 edges, every node field
  equal); ~1.5x wall on a small corpus where WASM init dominates, larger on big ones. `atomicWrite`
  also learned to write through non-regular files instead of renaming over them. (perf-quality
  finding 7)
- **Python re-export resolution is a table lookup, and every file is masked once.**
  `pyReExportResolve` re-masked the whole module and re-scanned its from-imports on EVERY
  invocation — once per unresolved `pkg.member(...)` call site and per imported name, measured at
  70% of a Python-corpus extract — and `maskPy`/`maskJs` ran up to 4x/2x per file across the
  symbol/extent/import/edge scans. Each module's re-export table and each `(module, name)`
  resolution are now memoized (first-valid-binding-wins preserves the old scan order; nulls cache
  only from depth-0 calls so a depth-truncated null can't mask a resolvable chain), and a shared
  per-file mask cache serves all five scan sites. Byte-identical fragments on a 261-file
  re-export corpus (1,460 edges, zero field diffs). (perf-quality finding 8)
- **Blast radius de-quadratic'd — `risk` is 31x faster at 20k nodes.** `impactOf` dequeued with
  `shift()` (O(frontier) per pop) and materialized+sorted closures its biggest caller threw away;
  `risk` then ran it once per node — measured 19.8s at 20k nodes/60k edges, scaling ~quadratically.
  Now: index-pointer BFS in `impactOf` (and the extractor's pub-API walk), a count-only
  `impactCountOf`, and `allBlastCounts` — Tarjan-condense the dependents graph, then propagate 64
  source-components per pass with word masks (O(V·E/64) time, O(V) memory, dangling edge sources
  participate exactly as in the BFS). risk: 19,784ms → 630ms with byte-identical payloads
  (blast sums equal); a property test pins all three implementations to each other on random
  graphs. (perf-quality finding 9)
- **The STAMP TIER: a no-change warm extract reads zero files.** Even on 100% cache hits, warm
  extraction re-read, re-hashed, re-split and re-masked every byte (the cache recovered ~15%; at
  16k symbols a no-change re-map spent ~3.7s on pure re-verification — the floor under the
  post-edit hook and MCP auto-refresh). The scan cache now stores every per-file product — nodes
  with extents/signatures/complexity, ranges, dynamic flag, raw re-export table, import bindings —
  and an mtime+size stamp: a matching stamp reuses all of it with ONE stat and NO read (measured:
  760ms cold → ~125ms warm on a 63-file corpus, banner `scanned 0/63 … ast: idle`). Correctness
  gates: role-override changes invalidate the tier (rulesSig); re-export tables gate on the file
  list (fileSig); bindings gate on symbol set + file list (bindSig) and lazily re-read exactly the
  files a landscape change invalidates. The tier trusts the same stamps `checkStaleness` trusts;
  `CODEWEB_VERIFY_FRESHNESS=1` or `--full` forces the read+hash path. Verified byte-identical
  against the no-cache oracle and the 40-trial incremental-equivalence property suite.
  (perf-quality finding 10)
- **`parseSignature` compiles zero regexes.** It built a fresh `RegExp` from the (mostly unique)
  symbol name for every function/method node — 717ms self / 27% of a 2.9s regex-path extract in
  profile; V8's regex cache never helps unique sources (micro: 8,400 unique-name constructions =
  527ms vs 1.6ms for the scan floor). Replaced with an `indexOf` scan performing the identical
  match — same left boundary, same optional `= [async] [function[*] [id]]` group semantics
  (async still requires trailing whitespace, exactly as `async\s+` did), first completing
  occurrence wins. Zero fragment diffs on the A/B corpus. (perf-quality finding 11)
- **ctags runs once per cold extract, not once per file.** The ctags engine spawned one
  `execFileSync` per file inside the main loop (≥0.9s of pure spawn floor per 600 files measured
  with a no-op shim; ~10x with real ctags option parsing — minutes of process churn at repo
  scale). Cold runs now tag the whole list through ONE process (`-L -`, list on stdin, bucketed by
  the JSON `path` field); warm runs keep the per-file spawn (misses are few, and one small spawn
  beats re-tagging the repo); an untouched warm run spawns nothing (stamp tier). Same graceful
  ladder on failure: batch → per-file → regex scanner. Shim-verified: exactly one batch on cold,
  zero on no-change warm, exactly one per-file on a one-file edit. (perf-quality finding 12)
- **The bench gate now guards every stage and every advisor, under real load.** The only timing
  gate used to measure the stage-REUSE path (which skips overlap/optimize entirely) — a 10x
  regression in any post-graph stage passed CI, which is exactly how the quadratic risk loop
  shipped. Now: (a) per-stage wall times parse from `run.mjs`'s own stderr and each gates as a
  factor of the regex-extract baseline (budgets note observed values so headroom stays honest);
  (b) a pinned deterministic loaded corpus (`bench/lib/loaded-corpus.mjs`: every function a twin
  candidate, 15 planted same-name clusters, ~1,260 candidates so LSH engages on its own — the old
  synthetic corpus produced 0 candidates and timed an idle engine) with gates that the planted
  clusters are FOUND and the LSH banner fired; (c) risk/deadcode/hotspots/campaign each timed and
  factor-gated, and a crashed advisor is itself a violation (observed: risk 0.18x — the
  pre-finding-9 loop would have measured ~20x and failed on arrival). The report expand-all bench
  row (d) lands with the finding-21 layout rewrite it measures. (perf-quality finding 13)
- **campaign's merge chain stopped cloning the graph per candidate.** The cumulative pre-flight
  ran `applyEdit` (a whole-graph `structuredClone`) plus full file-SCC for every ready merge —
  289ms/candidate at 20k nodes, the exact pattern optimize's Spec O-1 had already replaced. The
  pair-witness delta simulator now lives in graph-ops (`createMergeSimulator`, one truth) with
  chaining commits (`commit`/`commitDelete`) so deletes and accepted merges advance the same
  table; optimize rides it too (its `CODEWEB_OPT_SIM=clone` escape and equivalence tests intact).
  Measured: 100 candidates at 20k nodes/60k edges = 20,757ms → 729ms (28.5x) with identical
  accept decisions; a 120-case property oracle replays the historical clone chain verbatim and
  requires step-for-step plan equality. (perf-quality finding 14)
- **The edit/PR duplication gate prefilters by set size and caps bodies like overlap does.**
  `incrementalOverlap` ran full Jaccard intersections for every changed×pool pair (the dominant
  gate term on big PRs) and shingled thousand-line bodies in full while overlap confirmed the
  same pair on its first 400 lines. Now: an exact size-ratio early-exit (`J ≤ min/max` — measured
  78% of 37,350 self-map pairs skipped, with 5e-7 slack so knife-edge pairs that round to the bar
  survive) plus overlap's `BODY_LINE_CAP`. A 40-case property test pins prefiltered results to a
  filterless oracle. (perf-quality finding 15)
- **`find_similar` stops re-shingling the repo on every call.** The MCP server prescribes it
  before every new function an agent writes, and each call re-read and re-shingled every non-test
  body from disk. The report stage now persists each candidate's exact K=3 shingle SET (sorted,
  deterministic — sets, not sketches, so there is no probabilistic cut) in a stamped
  `similar-index.json` beside the graph; find-similar serves from it with zero source reads plus
  an exact size-ratio precut, and reuses the scoring pass for `scanned`. Stale/absent sidecar or
  `--structural` falls back to the live path; a regression test pins byte-identical matches
  across sidecar, live, stale-fallback, and removed-sidecar paths. (perf-quality finding 16)
- **One scan cache per workspace — the first hook fire after a map is no longer cold.** run.mjs,
  the post-edit hook, and refresh each used a DIFFERENT cache filename for the same workspace
  (`.scan-cache.json` / `scan-cache.json` / `extract-cache.json`), so the first post-edit hook
  after every map ran a cold full re-scan (28.7s at 16k symbols against the hook's 30s timeout)
  and the first MCP auto-refresh was cold too. All three now share `SCAN_CACHE_NAME` from
  lib/cli.mjs — and the hook dropped its lone `--no-ctags`, which on ctags machines both thrashed
  the engine-namespaced cache AND diffed a regex fragment against a ctags baseline (phantom
  regressions). With finding 10, a no-change hook/refresh now scans zero files. (perf-quality
  finding 17)
- **The post-edit hook's fast-path floor, specified and landed** (`docs/specs/hook-fastpath-floor.md`
  — the "baseline-fragment reuse" spec `fastpath-daemon.md` called for, in its landed form: the
  reuse rides the stamp tier's per-file products, serving every extract consumer). The hook's
  fragment now streams back on stdout — the pid-named temp file (~1.2MB, never unlinked, leaked
  per edit forever) is gone entirely, along with a full serialize+write+read cycle — and the
  extractor skips its multi-MB cache write-back when no entry changed (`cacheDirty`). Measured at
  8,804 nodes/52k edges: hook end-to-end ~800ms warm (was ~4s-class; full re-extract alone was
  3,350ms), decomposed in the spec with revisit triggers pointing at finding 25's in-process
  extraction. (perf-quality finding 18)
- **The MCP server no longer head-of-line-blocks, and stale graphs heal in the background.**
  Every non-fast-path tool ran through `spawnSync` on the readline loop — a 2.5ms structural
  query measured at 527.6ms behind a concurrent campaign, and a stale graph stalled the current
  call behind an inline synchronous refresh (up to 4–28s at the 16k benchmark; 120s behind a
  wedged child). Children now spawn async (the `handleMap` pattern generalized), serialized per
  workspace so stateful sequences keep their order while fast paths and other workspaces never
  wait; auto-refresh is fire-and-forget, serving the stale-but-ANNOTATED answer immediately —
  and because the server drains in-flight work before exit, the next call is fresh. Measured:
  callers behind a concurrent campaign 527.6ms → 2.4ms. (perf-quality finding 19)
- **The tools the server prescribes per edit answer in-process.** `codeweb_explain` and
  `codeweb_context` — the INSTRUCTIONS' before-every-edit calls — took the spawn path (node boot
  + a fresh multi-MB graph parse per call, ~256ms measured back-to-back) while structural queries
  answered from the cache in ~3–13ms. context-pack's payload assembly moved to
  `lib/context-core.mjs` (one truth, two transports — byte-identical JSON, field order included);
  explain rides `buildCards` as the sidecar already did; and context-pack's `--json` miss now
  emits the same `found:false` + suggestions contract explain adopted in #2 (the old stderr
  `die()` made MCP reply an empty string). Measured, even while a campaign runs: explain 9.3ms,
  context 12.3ms. (perf-quality finding 20)
- **The report's graph sim is grid-based, frame-budgeted, and freeze-free.** `gStep` computed
  all-pairs repulsion per animation frame — 1,174ms/frame measured at 16.3k nodes (×~259 anneal
  frames ≈ 5 minutes of sim CPU for one "Expand all" click), and the `prefers-reduced-motion`
  branch ran the whole anneal in ONE synchronous task (a hard freeze, not jank). Now: a uniform
  spatial grid (only 3×3-neighborhood pairs interact — deterministic, 11.5x on the dense
  micro-bench and far more on real spread-out layouts), a wall-clock frame budget (8ms of sim per
  frame — small graphs settle in a blink, huge ones stay responsive), and the reduced-motion
  settle chunked into ≤12ms slices with a single final draw. Spec L's harness gained the
  expand-all row (finding 13(d)): `simMsPerFrame` recorded and judged in the verdict, so the
  cliff that sat one click past the old green can never regress unmeasured. (perf-quality
  finding 21)
- **Temp hygiene: nothing leaks into the OS tmpdir.** The post-edit hook's per-edit ~1.2MB leak
  died with finding 18 (no temp file exists at all); the two test files that leaked
  (`stdout-flush`'s three `codeweb-flush-*` dirs, `efficiency-pilot-usage`'s `cw-usage-*` dir)
  now clean up in `finally`; and a tripwire in `post-edit-diff.test.mjs` runs the hook end-to-end
  and asserts no `codeweb-hook-*.json` appears — the leak signature can't return silently.
  (perf-quality finding 22)
- **SessionStart serves a pre-rendered brief; MCP sweeps staleness once per burst.** The
  session-brief hook re-parsed and re-indexed the whole graph every session start (97–100ms on
  this repo, 310–328ms at 17k nodes) for a payload that is a pure function of the graph — the
  report stage now pre-renders `brief.json` (Spec P stamp pattern) and the hook serves it at the
  boot floor, byte-identical output pinned across sidecar/parse/stale-fallback paths. The MCP
  server also stat-swept every `meta.sources` entry TWICE per fast-path request (auto-refresh
  check + payload annotation — 2×12–17ms at 5k files against 3–13ms answers); one memoized
  verdict per (graph identity, 1s TTL) now serves both, threaded through context-core so the CLI
  path is untouched. (perf-quality finding 23)

### Added
- **Specs K–P, landed on main after v0.9.0** (previously missing from this section — the release
  script would have refused to roll an "empty" release over real work):
  - **K — the scale bench is runnable** (`bench/experiments/scale.mjs` portable + pre-flighted);
    it found the next wall, which N then removed.
  - **L — report.html measured at 16k symbols** (`bench/results/report-scale.json`): cold load,
    interaction, and heap all green at TypeScript-compiler scale — no fix needed, receipt kept.
  - **M — the efficiency pilot re-ran budgeted on v0.9.0** (5 engine-frozen reps,
    `bench/experiments/efficiency-pilot.reps5-v090.json`): recall **+0.31 ± 0.04** at equal token
    cost — the earlier ">90% fewer tokens" prediction was wrong and is recorded as such; the win
    moved from cost to completeness. One per-task loss (flask) opened Spec Q.
  - **N — LSH/MinHash banding in overlap** (`CODEWEB_LSH`, auto at scale): the quadratic
    same-name/twin passes band first, making the scale caps true backstops; identical findings on
    small inputs, byte-stable.
  - **O — incremental stages, O-1** (extract rides the scan cache inside `run.mjs`; downstream
    stages memoize on the fragment hash). O-2 (incremental cluster/overlap) measured under the
    pre-registered rule and **deliberately not built** — the override is recorded in the spec.
  - **P — resident daemon: NO-GO** (`docs/decisions/fastpath-daemon.md`): the per-edit surface is
    already at the ~52ms node-boot floor via the **pre-edit sidecar** (`index-lite.json`), and a
    resident graph risks stale-serving; revisit triggers documented.
- **A symbol miss is never a dead end.** Every `found:false` answer (query/dependents/impact
  over CLI and MCP, `explain`, `context-pack`) now carries a hint pointing at `codeweb_find`
  concept search plus up to 3 deterministic near-match ids (case-fix, prefix, substring,
  shared-name-token tiers) — the most frequent agent mistake now teaches the recovery path
  instead of sending the agent back to grep. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #2)

### Added
- **Every ranked surface now honors the role model — and deadcode knows what a host invokes.**
  The vite-playground precision lesson (rankings drowned by non-product code) was applied to
  overlap only; hotspots, risk, deadcode, and campaign still ranked test helpers, bench scaffolding,
  and the generated site bundle first on codeweb's own map. All four now default to **product
  scope** with a counted exclusion line (`--all` / MCP `all:true` restores the everything view).
  `deadcode` additionally learns **manifest-declared entrypoints** — files named by any
  `package.json` `main`/`bin`/`exports`, `hooks/hooks.json`, or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` are
  review-tier, never "safe to delete" (the safe tier used to list the VS Code extension's
  `activate`/`deactivate`) — and demotes **closure-scoped** functions (defined inside a reachable
  parent's span) to review. Dogfood receipts on the self-map: hotspots' top-10 went from five test
  helpers + the generated site bundle to all product code; campaign's plan dropped from 55 steps
  (-730 claimed LOC, mostly false orphans) to 26 grounded ones. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #6)
- **The report now shows the pipeline's own findings — and every view is a link.** The
  interactive report loaded `graph.overlaps` and never rendered it: the Findings tab showed only
  a client-side name-match heuristic, so the body-confirmed, tiered findings in
  `overlap.md`/`optimize.md` never reached the report's audience. A new **Consolidation
  findings** section now leads the tab (confidence badges, evidence, recommendation, clickable
  symbols; body-refuted candidates counted). The URL hash grew from node-only `#s=` to the whole
  view — `#tab=…&roles=…&s=…` — restored on load (legacy links keep working), with a
  **copy link** button in the header; hosted reports carry `og:title`/`og:description` built
  from the target label and counts only (the meta.root privacy invariant holds, re-pinned by
  test). (IMPROVEMENTS.md #8)
- **The report meets people where they are: light mode, print, full keyboard reach.** A light
  theme follows the OS preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) with an explicit auto → light → dark
  toggle (persisted; the canvas graph re-reads its label/halo colors from the theme tokens); a
  print stylesheet makes the report paper-able; every hover affordance gained a
  `:focus-visible` twin; matrix cells and treemap blocks are keyboard-reachable
  (tabindex + Enter/Space + `aria-label`); the tablist has real `tabpanel`/`aria-controls`
  wiring and roving arrow keys. Also: the undefined `--hi` token (the "duplicated" tag silently
  lost its color) now uses `--stCritical`; the treemap caches its render like sibling tabs; the
  mobile search-count no longer collides with the input; the editor-root picker is an inline
  form instead of a blocking `prompt()`; and the whole-panel `aria-live` (which re-read the
  entire inspector on every click) became a scoped one-line announcer. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #9)
- **The value receipt is felt, not buried.** The session brief's activity line used to render
  only the current calendar month's bucket and vanish when it was empty — every new user and
  every 1st-of-the-month saw silence. It now leads with **lifetime totals** ("codeweb here since
  2026-06: …", current month in parentheses), the brief warns when the map is a week old
  ("built N day(s) ago — refresh with codeweb_refresh"), a successful `run.mjs` map ends with
  the receipt line, and CLI queries (`query`/`explain`/`context-pack`) now count toward
  `queriesServed` — the denominator stops undercounting non-MCP use. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #10)
- **The agent loop closes over MCP — 27 tools — and codeweb_map reports progress.** Three
  capabilities that existed only as CLIs join the MCP surface: **`codeweb_simulate`** (the
  regression gate's verdict for a hypothetical delete/merge/move — pre-flight a refactor for the
  cost of one call), **`codeweb_annotate`** (false-positive suppression memory, written beside
  the graph, never to source), and **`codeweb_stats`** (the local value receipt). `codeweb_map`
  is now async and, when the client sends a `progressToken`, emits `notifications/progress` per
  pipeline stage — a big first map is no longer a silent black box (in-flight work drains before
  the server exits). The MCP/CLI **parity receipt is re-measured at the full surface**
  (`bench/results/auxiliary.json`): 26/26 parity pairs + JSON-RPC conformance at 27 listed tools,
  11/11 auxiliary checks green — the old receipt covered the 20-tool era and its harness had the
  count hardcoded (now derived). The handshake instructions teach the new loop steps.
  (IMPROVEMENTS.md #11)
- **Coverage→symbol mapping — "is this symbol actually tested?" is now a measured fact.**
  (ROADMAP Phase 4's named-missing mechanism.) `scripts/coverage.mjs` (`npm run coverage`)
  ingests a coverage report — lcov text (Node's own
  `--test --experimental-test-coverage --test-reporter=lcov` output works directly) or a
  c8/istanbul JSON — and stamps every instrumented symbol with `covered`/`hits` (declaration-line
  hits don't count as body execution; unknown ≠ uncovered; ambiguous path suffixes dropped).
  `explain`, `query --tests`, and `context-pack` answers then carry the facts — loudest one:
  `⚠ NOT covered by the recorded test run` on the edit window of an unguarded symbol.
  Optional + explicit like `--churn` (absent input leaves graphs byte-identical);
  `run.mjs --coverage <report>` annotates right after mapping; `codeweb_refresh` drops stale
  annotations and says how to restore them. Pinned end-to-end by `tests/coverage.test.mjs`,
  including a real Node-runner dogfood. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #13)
- **Ruby and PHP join the dispatch tier; Kotlin/Swift's blocker is recorded, not papered over.**
  Two new vendored grammars (same pinned trusted source, `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@0.3.1`; Ruby
  ABI 14, PHP ABI 15) power Spec-F-pattern walkers: Ruby wires `self.`/implicit-receiver calls
  inside a class (the parser has already disambiguated a call from a bare identifier, so wiring
  to a sibling method is precision-safe); PHP wires `$this->m()` plus `Type $p` typed-receiver
  intents under the one-owner rule. The regex tier's bare-name resolution simultaneously got
  STRICTER for both languages — a bare name can never reach another file's owner-qualified
  method on a name coincidence anymore (that attribution now belongs to the dispatch tier, which
  has receiver evidence). Kotlin/Swift stay regex-only with the blocker recorded in
  `PROVENANCE.md`: no trusted wasm exists at our pinned ABI (upstream ships C sources and native
  prebuilds only) — revisit when `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm` grows them. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #14)
- **The gate is a reviewer for adopters, not just a red ✗.** codeweb's own PRs already got the
  sticky structural-review comment (delta, renames, findings); the reusable composite action
  third parties consume ran the gate silently. The action now takes `comment: true` and posts
  (and updates in place) the same digest via the calling workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` — the comment
  lands **before** the verdict can fail the job, fork PRs with read-only tokens degrade
  gracefully to the check verdict, and `docs/ci-gate.md` documents the
  `pull-requests: write` requirement. Reviewers who never installed codeweb now see the blast
  radius of every gated PR where they already look. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #15)
- **The CLI grew a front door.** Every CLI answers `--help`/`-h` (exit 0) — including the
  `codeweb` bin, where `--help` previously errored with `target not found: --help`; `run.mjs`
  documents all its flags, rejects unknown ones with usage (exit 2), and ends a successful map
  with `open <ws>/report.html in your browser`. Graph resolution now walks up to the nearest
  `.codeweb/graph.json` above the cwd when no path/`CODEWEB_WS` is given (the same discovery the
  hooks and MCP server already used) and announces which graph it picked — so bare
  `npm run stats`, `query.mjs --callers X`, and `context-pack.mjs <symbol>` work from anywhere
  inside a mapped repo. Exit codes on the first-touch scripts (`run`, `extract-symbols`,
  `build-report`) now follow the documented 0/1/2 convention. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #5)

### Fixed
- **Spec Q closed: the flask Python import-edge regression was real, and it's fixed.** The
  spec's bisect contract was executed first: the reps8-era engine (`c892f50`) resolved 14
  `render_template` dependents, v0.9.0 resolved 7 — the package-boundary precision rule had also
  killed calls backed by an explicit `from flask import render_template`. Three Python
  resolution gaps fixed (each pinned by `tests/python-src-layout.test.mjs`): single-segment
  absolute imports now resolve the repo's OWN top-level package (rooted, src-layout aware —
  `import json` still can't grab a nested in-repo package); `__init__.py` re-exports are
  followed (bounded chain) on both the from-import and the `pkg.member()` paths; an explicit
  import binds bare calls across package boundaries (the import is evidence — unimported bare
  names still respect the boundary); module-level import sites attribute to `<module>` (site
  granularity). Flask pre-flight: **7 → 48 dependents, 26/26 truth sites** under id
  normalization. `SCANNER_VERSION` 11→12 (cached edges invalidate); the research-page caveat now
  records the closure. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #12)
- **The VS Code lens is truthful again — and covers all 11 languages.** The extension README
  promised "the lens re-reads the graph on change," but no watcher or change-event existed:
  lenses showed stale numbers until a file was reopened. A `FileSystemWatcher` on
  `**/.codeweb/graph.json` now fires `onDidChangeCodeLenses` (debounced), a manual
  `codeweb: Refresh CodeLens from the graph` command exists, and the language selector grew from
  9 to the engine's 11 (Ruby/PHP/Kotlin/Swift files finally get lenses). Extension v0.2.0.
  (IMPROVEMENTS.md #7)
- **The public prose can no longer understate the product — and what it said is fixed.** The
  homepage, product page, start page, and og-descriptions said "20 tools" (24 ship); the /codeweb
  command steered agents off the fast path for 8 of the 11 native languages; the engine-detection
  reference said five; README's axios headline carried pre-regeneration numbers (334/11 vs the
  real 274/8); the site still promised the deleted sharding layer; the tree-sitter backlog doc
  claimed "nothing wired" about a tier that shipped two releases ago. All fixed at the source —
  site prose now derives counts (`{{toolCount}}`/`{{langCount}}`), and `check-consistency` gained
  **prose scans** (digit and word forms) plus a claim-ledger "N / N tools" check, so this class of
  rot now fails the build. Site prose counts are template-derived (toolCount/langCount
  placeholders filled at build time). The 2026-07-18 product review is archived to
  `docs/product-review-2026-07-18.md` with a historical header. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #3)
- **`npm test` is green again on a fresh zero-dependency clone.** The Spec-N LSH suite's N6 case
  asserts a Type-3 (AST-tier-only) finding but was missing the `tree-sitter unavailable` skip
  guard every other AST test carries — so the suite failed 1 test exactly on the "just Node"
  install path the README celebrates (CI never saw it because CI installs the optional
  dependency). Verified both ways: runs with the engine, skips without. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #4)
- **An empty scan no longer masquerades as a successful map.** Pointing codeweb at an empty
  directory, an unsupported-language tree, or a typo'd path used to print a green `[run] done`
  and write a blank report. The extractor now stops with an actionable message — the path it
  scanned, the supported extensions, and "is this the right directory?" — and `run.mjs` aborts
  before writing artifacts. `--allow-empty` (both CLIs) keeps intentionally-sparse targets
  workable. (IMPROVEMENTS.md #1)

### Removed
- **spike/ and .live/ are out of the tree — the self-map stops counting prototypes.**
  `spike/tree-sitter/` was a graduated prototype (the engine shipped as `lib/ts-engine.mjs` in
  PR #17) still tracked with its own package.json and drifted copies of production functions;
  `.live/` tracked five dev scripts nothing referenced, every one superseded by shipped code
  (confirm.mjs → overlap's body confirmation, rust-dissect.mjs → the native Rust tier,
  cli-sketch/ → finding 24's `parseArgs`, measure.mjs → cluster3). Both deleted — git history
  keeps them; prose references now say so. `.live/` is fully gitignored (it stays run.mjs's
  default workspace target, generated artifacts only), and `codeweb.rules.json` gains standing
  `spike/** → example` and `.live/** → generated` role overrides so a future prototype tree can
  never pollute the self-metrics again. Self-map effect: 13 → 12 domains (spike/tree-sitter
  gone), 33 → 28 self-overlap findings (all five spike-only findings gone), 1,240 → 1,215 nodes.
  (perf-quality finding 28)

### Changed
- **THE similarity thresholds live once — and churn is bounded and cached.** The 0.6
  high-confidence floor (with the 0.35/0.15 bands) was independently hardcoded in four files and
  the K=3 shingle size in five, each copy documenting the coupling in a "must match overlap.mjs"
  comment instead of importing it. `lib/shingles.mjs` now exports `BANDS`/`K`; overlap's
  confidence tiers, optimize's READY floor, find-similar's tiers + low-band cutoff, dup-check's
  HIGH gate, similar-index's SIMILAR_K, and skeleton's default all import them (values unchanged
  — pipeline outputs byte-identical). Same disease, different organ: the full-history `git log`
  churn parser was byte-near-identical in risk.mjs and hotspots.mjs, unbounded (whole history
  per advisory run) and uncached (campaign ran it twice back-to-back). `lib/churn.mjs` now owns
  it: windowed to the last 5,000 commits (deterministic per HEAD, unlike a `--since` that drifts
  with the clock) and cached beside the graph keyed by `rev-parse HEAD` + window — on this repo,
  hotspots `--git` after risk `--git` serves from the cache in ~97ms with zero git spawns.
  `tests/churn.test.mjs` pins counts, the poison-proved cache hit, HEAD invalidation, the window
  bound, and the not-a-repo `{}` degradation. (perf-quality finding 27)
- **One dispatch skeleton, seven language tables.** `ts-engine.mjs` repeated its per-language
  dispatch walker seven times (Java/C# via a shape closure; Ruby/PHP/Python/Go/Rust as five
  hand-copied closures), with `up()` defined five times in two drifted signatures,
  `typedParamsOf` four times plus a renamed `paramTypesOf`, and the owner-index + dedupe + sort
  epilogue cloned per language — the same-name copies were also why deadcode showed @-suffixed
  orphan ids for this file. Now `makeDispatchWalker(parser, table)` owns THE skeleton (ancestor
  climb `upTo`, `typedParamsFrom`, seen-key dedupe, sorted `{thisCalls, typedIntents}` return,
  try/finally `tree.delete()`), and each language declares only its genuine tree shape:
  `collectOwners` / `callSite` / `enclosingOf` / `isSelf` / `identName` / `typedParams` —
  ~25 declarative lines per language, 762→735 total with seven walkers collapsed to one.
  Verified byte-identical on a purpose-built 7-language dispatch corpus (this-calls AND typed
  intents wired in every language, incl. Go receiver-variable "self", Rust `&`-ref stripping,
  PHP nullable-type params) plus pycorp and corpus7; language/AST suites and the full 582-test
  run green. (perf-quality finding 26)
- **The extractor is decomposed — and testable in-process.** `extract-symbols.mjs` was a
  1,500-line script/module hybrid: per-language scan rules, body extents, signatures, import/
  re-export/member resolution, and the caches all interleaved, with `byName`/`files` as module
  globals — so every extractor test shelled out (253 `runNode(` spawn sites across the suite).
  Two pure modules now hold the substance: `lib/lang-rules.mjs` (the 11-language regex symbol
  scan, `bodyEnd` brace/dedent extents, `parseSignature`, KEYWORDS/DYNAMIC_RE/langOf — functions
  of their arguments, no IO) and `lib/import-resolve.mjs` (`createImportResolver(ctx)` — relative
  and Python module resolution, JS/TS re-export chains incl. `export *`, Python from-import
  re-export tables, unique-member lookup, and per-file import binding, all over injected context
  with no module-global state). The orchestrator keeps enumeration, caching (stamp/hash/bind/rex
  replay), engines, and edge derivation — 968 lines, down from 1,506 — and the extractor's own
  `SRC` extension list is now the shared `SRC_RE` from `lib/common.mjs` (the hand-mirrored copy
  the file itself warned could drift). Bodies moved verbatim; proof: fragments byte-identical
  old-vs-new on four corpora × both engine tiers × cold/warm/replayed-cache paths, including an
  old-engine scan cache replayed by the new engine, plus a same-tree self-map A/B. The first
  in-process extractor tests land with it (`tests/lang-rules.test.mjs`: 10 cases, 137ms, zero
  spawns — the seam #30's spawn-collapse needs). (perf-quality finding 25)
- **One flag loop.** 25 scripts carried the identical hand-rolled `for (…argv…)` parse with three
  drifting policies — `run.mjs` rejected unknown flags (the documented #5 convention) while
  `trend`/`build-report`/`extract-symbols` still swallowed them as positional paths (the exact bug
  class #5 fixed: `--help` becoming the target path), and several CLIs answered no `--help` at all
  (ci-gate, screenshot, extract-symbols). `lib/cli.mjs` now owns THE loop — declarative
  `parseArgs(argv, spec)` with one policy: unknown flag → exit 2 with usage, `--help`/`-h` → usage
  and exit 0, typed values (`bool`/`string`/`number`/`float`/`pair`) with missing/non-numeric
  values rejected by name. All 25 scripts migrated to ~10-line specs (hand-written usage strings
  kept — they're part of tested contracts); `build-report` also drops its near-verbatim copy of
  the graph-load error handling and rides `loadGraph` like every other tool. The pure helpers
  (`SRC_RE`, `SCAN_CACHE_NAME`, `sign`, `capList`) moved to side-effect-free `lib/common.mjs`
  (re-exported from cli.mjs) so stage scripts can import constants without cli.mjs's module-level
  EPIPE handler. Dogfood: this was codeweb's only HIGH-confidence self-finding, now zero
  hand-rolled loops remain (`grep` proof: the one flag loop left is parseArgs itself).

### Fixed
- **Releases are gated.** Tag-push and workflow-dispatch publishing both flow through a `test` job
  first — `publish` now `needs:` the full suite plus the consistency check, so a failing suite
  blocks the release instead of shipping past it. Dispatched refs must be ancestors of `origin/main`
  (checked before the tag is created; a stray branch can no longer become a tagged release), and
  `@vscode/vsce` is exact-pinned to 3.9.2 at both call sites instead of executing whatever npm
  serves as `@latest` that day. `tests/workflows.test.mjs` pins the gates as text invariants —
  the round-1 regression class was gates silently dropped from these files.
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #2)

### Changed
- **CI got breadth, and the AST tier can no longer silently un-test itself.** The test job runs an
  os x node matrix (ubuntu/windows x Node 22/24, npm cache on every setup-node block); after
  `npm ci` a probe (`node -e "await import('web-tree-sitter')"`) fails the job when the
  optionalDependency install hiccuped, and the skip count is bounded (ceiling 8 = a named runner
  census of 7 environment skips — 3 golden-target, 1 TS_MODULE bench, 1 inverse fallback, 2
  playwright report-scale — + 1 headroom; windows runs its own ceiling 11, its leg adding exactly
  the 3 named ctags-shim platform skips; the tier-wide failure mode adds ~38 skips and trips
  either ceiling hard; both node 22's TAP and node 24's spec-style summaries are parsed). A new
  `test-no-ast` job installs with
  `--omit=optional` and proves the regex fallback green stand-alone, asserting the
  fallback-equivalence test ran UN-skipped (it inverse-skips wherever the engine is installed —
  i.e. always in the matrix job). `codeweb-gate.yml` now runs `npm ci`, so the structural self-gate
  analyzes PRs with the same engine tier the product ships instead of regex-blind. `engines` says
  `>=22` honestly — Node 20's `npm test` glob is broken and the matrix never tested it. The
  matrix's first real windows catch: `bench/all.mjs` dynamic-imported a bare absolute path — an
  unsupported ESM scheme on windows (`D:\...`) that crashed the whole bench; it imports via
  `file://` URL now. (perf-quality round 2, finding #3)
- **The suite's 60-second floor is gone.** IE-EQUIVALENCE ran its 40 property trials sequentially
  in one `test()` (59.8 s solo — nothing else exceeded 13.3 s); the trials now run as concurrent
  subtests (cap 4) over the new async spawn helper `runNodeAsync`, with the depth env-gated as
  `CODEWEB_IE_TRIALS` (40 in CI — unchanged depth — / 10 local; a typo'd value throws instead of
  passing vacuously). Per-trial seeds make trials independent and concurrency-safe: fixture bytes
  differ from the serial version, the semantics class (random 2–6-step mutation sequences, warm ≡
  cold assert per step) does not. 40 trials: 58.0 s → 15.3 s; full suite ~93 s → ~55 s class.
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #6)
- **Correction to the round-1 claim.** Commit `bfc6b92` ("implementation (all 32 findings)") did
  NOT land findings 29–32 — the release gate, the test split, the CI matrix/skip guards, and the
  consistency-gate coverage; this changelog documented findings 1–28 only. They ship in this round
  as findings #2/#6/#3/#4. The four dropped items were precisely the gates that would have caught
  the drop, so the honest closer is structural, not narrative: per-finding changelog entries land
  WITH each finding (an empty [Unreleased] can no longer be rolled over shipped work), and the
  package.json prose scan (finding #4) plus its regression tests make the surface where the drop
  was publicly visible fail the build by itself. (perf-quality round 2, finding #1)

### Fixed
- **The consistency gate scans package.json — and the npm listing stops lying.** The description
  said "24 MCP tools" while 27 shipped, and `check-consistency` printed OK over it because
  package.json was in neither the prose scans nor the sync targets. The gate now scans the
  description (description-only — keywords/scripts can't false-positive), version-sync repairs the
  count at every roll, the live drift is corrected to 27, and the drifted-fixture round-trip in
  `tests/release-tooling.test.mjs` pins the class. Mid-change, the scan alone turned the real-repo
  consistency tests red on the live drift — the gate catching, in-repo, exactly what it was built
  for. (perf-quality round 2, finding #4)
- **`npm test` no longer rewrites tracked docs/ — and the published site can't go stale again.**
  `site/build.mjs` gained `--out <dir>` (the shared parseArgs loop; unknown flags die), the whole
  site-build suite builds into a temp dir, CI asserts docs/ is byte-fresh after the build
  (`git diff --exit-code -- docs` plus an untracked-outputs check), and the stale committed
  `docs/changelog.html` — the published Pages changelog was missing the round-1 "Removed" section
  at HEAD — is rebuilt and committed. Argv-less callers (release.mjs, `npm run build:site`, CI)
  keep the docs/ default. (perf-quality round 2, finding #5)
- **The docs drift trio.** (a) `--engine` now validates its value — unknown engines (including a
  typo'd `CODEWEB_ENGINE`, which feeds the same default) exit 2 with the valid set instead of
  silently ENABLING the AST tier, and README's nonexistent `--engine read` mode is gone (`ts`
  stays a valid tree-sitter alias). (b) The release-tag skill's runbook numbers match reality
  (~590 tests, up to ~5 environment skips — it said "~400, tree-sitter-absence"). (c)
  `scripts/release.mjs` exits 1 when its own consistency audit fails, BEFORE printing the gated
  git commands — release prep can no longer end in "consistency: N problem(s)" followed by the
  exact commands to ship anyway. (perf-quality round 2, finding #7)
- **One huge single-line string can no longer kill the entire extract.** The string regexes in
  `complexity.mjs`'s strip, `maskRuby`'s RB_DQ/RB_SQ, and ts-engine's `stmtHash` used the
  alternation form V8 recurses per character — a >=8.4 MB inlined string (base64 asset, dataset)
  threw an uncaught RangeError from `cyclomatic` in BOTH tiers, taking the whole map, post-edit
  hook, and MCP refresh with it. All three sites now use the unrolled-loop form, preserving each
  site's escape atom (`\\.` vs `\\[^]` — they differ on backslash-newline in templates; a seeded
  5,000-case per-site equivalence property pins each), and `cyclomatic`/`nestingDepth` are belted:
  any internal throw degrades that node to 1/0 instead of killing the run — combined with
  ts-engine's existing null-on-throw per-file fallback, no single file can kill an extract in
  either tier. `SCANNER_VERSION` 13 -> 14 so warm caches can't replay pre-fix products.
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #15)
- **The JS masker learned nested templates.** `maskJs`'s two scalars (inTemplate, exprDepth) could
  not represent a template inside `${}` on ordinary modern JS: nested-template TEXT stayed live
  (`` `Usage: ${xs.map((n) => `fabricateMe(${n})`)}` `` fabricated a call edge), a `}` inside that
  nested text closed the interpolation and INVERTED template state (edges lost, extents run to
  EOF), an escaped `` \` `` did the same (no `\` handling in text), and `${}`-interior strings were
  kept verbatim even in blank-values mode (string content fabricated edges — deadcode's safe tier
  corrupted again, one idiom over from round 1's regex-literal fix). Template state is now a stack
  of frames (nested backticks push; text `\` consumes escapes; expr strings route through the
  keepValues gate, so codemod's two-view diff classifies a name inside `${'…'}` as inside-a-value),
  every delimiter backtick blanks in default mode, and default-mode `maskJs` is now IDEMPOTENT over
  the corpus — pinned with per-line length preservation by the new shared property suite
  (`tests/masking-properties.test.mjs`, corpus-scoped with the value-then-division counterexample
  documented). Five repro fixtures run under both engine tiers in
  `tests/maskjs-nested-templates.test.mjs`. (perf-quality round 2, finding #8)
- **Spread calls edge; IIFE-initialized consts are values, not functions.** The two mis-lexings
  that made BOTH of the self-map's deadcode "safe to delete" verdicts false: (a) `...metrics(` was
  routed into the member-call branch by the `.` before the match, where the backward identifier
  match can never succeed on dots — the call edge was silently DROPPED and `trend.mjs:metrics`
  showed 0 callers; a `..`-preceded match now falls through to `addEdge` (`a?.b(` and `...obj.fn(`
  verified unchanged). (b) The const-arrow rule matched `const PERM_SEEDS = (() => {…})()` — an
  IIFE-initialized VALUE became a `function` node invisible to callRe/refRe, a guaranteed deadcode
  false positive; `=(?!\s*\(\()` now rejects it (the accepted loss — a genuinely function-valued,
  non-invoked `const g = ((a) => a)` — is pinned in the test so re-widening is a conscious flip).
  Dogfood re-run: `trend.mjs:metrics` has 2 call edges in, `PERM_SEEDS` is no node, and the
  self-map deadcode safe tier is EMPTY (was: exactly these two false positives — campaign would
  have emitted DELETEs that break trend and minhash at runtime). The self-map regression is now a
  test (`tests/spread-iife-selfmap.test.mjs` extracts the real trend.mjs + minhash.mjs texts).
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #9)
- **Accessors both exist, declaration lines fabricate nothing, and the regex tier sees modern TS
  methods.** Three related truths: (a) the AST tier's method dedupe silently DROPPED the second
  body with a colliding id — always a real get/set pair or static/instance same-name (TS overload
  signatures are never framed); the second now suffixes `@` + its 1-based start line — the scheme
  the regex tier's file-level disambiguator already used, so both tiers emit byte-identical ids
  (getter keeps the bare id: no query/fingerprint churn) — and the cross-tier defensive dedupe
  suffixes instead of dropping. (b) The self-definition guard covered only a node's own start
  line, so setter/impl declaration lines were scanned as calls with the CLASS as scope —
  fabricated `Widget -> Widget.value` phantom callers hid every accessor/overloaded member from
  deadcode; a per-file declStarts map now skips any same-named declaration line, and body-less
  overload stubs (which have no range) are covered by a class-enclosed stub-line guard over both
  callRe and refRe (class-gated — narrowed from the audit's unconditional line guard, which would
  have suppressed 112 ordinary `finish(code);`-shaped statement lines in this repo alone).
  (c) The regex method matcher stacks modifiers, admits default params (`[^;]*` interior — not
  `[^;{}]*`, which would regress destructured params) and `: Type` return annotations —
  `get value(): number {`, `compute(n: any): number {`, `render(x = 1) {` were all invisible, their
  bodies' calls re-attributed to the class. Self-map after: zero class->own-member edges.
  `tests/accessor-overload-truth.test.mjs` runs the fixture in BOTH tiers and asserts identical id
  sets. (perf-quality round 2, finding #12)
- **Ruby heredocs and PHP `#` comments stop fabricating symbols and edges.** Ruby's symbol scan ran
  on RAW text and `maskRuby` had no heredoc state, so a `<<~SQL` body containing `helper(1)` and
  `def phantom_method` produced a phantom node and a fabricated module->helper call edge.
  `maskRuby` is now a stateful line loop with a FIFO queue of pending heredoc tags: body and
  terminator lines mask to empty lines (nothing inside a body can queue, scan, or edge), the
  opener TOKEN masks to the literal `''` so `sql = <<~SQL.strip` stays live code, `a << b` shift
  and `<<=` never match, stacked `f(<<~A, <<~B)` queues in order, and `~`/`-` tags terminate by
  trimmed equality while plain tags need column 0 — and the Ruby scan now consumes `masked('rb')`
  (the edge scan already did). PHP routes through `maskJs`, which now takes `{hashComment:true}`
  (.php only — JS private fields unaffected): `# legacy note: helper(1)` no longer fabricates a
  module->helper call. Accepted limits documented in the mask header: heredoc-interior `#{…}`
  interpolation blanks with the body (the pre-existing Ruby interpolation gap), and quoted-tag
  `<<~"TAG"` openers are eaten by the string replaces first (backtick-quoted tags still open).
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #13)
- **Python f-strings keep their `{…}` code.** `maskPy` treated f-strings as plain strings, so
  `return f"total={compute(x)}"` dropped the `report -> compute` edge — functions invoked only
  from f-strings (logging/formatting, idiomatic Python) showed 0 callers, poisoning caller counts
  and blast radii; the maskPy limit list didn't even mention it. A quote preceded by a 1-3 char
  `[rRbBuUfF]` run containing `f`/`F` (covers `f`, `rf`, `fr`, `Rf`, …) is now an f-string: `{…}`
  interpolation code is kept verbatim in both modes (the exact analogue of the JS `${}` rule) with
  a brace-depth counter for nested `{}` (dicts, `f"{x:{w}}"` format specs), `{{`/`}}` blank as
  text, triple-quoted f-strings carry expr state across lines, and a quoted run INSIDE the expr
  blanks through the keepValues gate as one slice — NOT verbatim, which would fabricate edges from
  string content (`f"{'compute(1)'}"`, the #8 n4 analogue — pinned by the decoy2 fixture) and
  break the shared idempotence property. keepValues output stays byte-identical to before
  (differentially verified). Limits documented in the header (nested same-quote f-strings are
  best-effort). (perf-quality round 2, finding #14)
- **NodeNext `.js` specifiers reach their `.ts/.tsx` sources.** Under
  `moduleResolution: node16/nodenext` TypeScript REQUIRES relative imports spelled with the
  emitted extension (`./x.js` for `./x.ts`) — the resolver's candidate list never mapped those
  back, so alias, namespace (`import * as u` → empty nsmap), and re-export edges silently
  vanished in modern TS repos, with the unique-bare-name rescue masking the hole just often
  enough to look random. One exported candidate builder (`importCandidates` + `EXT_REMAP`:
  `.js→.ts/.tsx`, `.mjs→.mts`, `.cjs→.cts`, `.jsx→.tsx`, plus the missing
  `/index.tsx|jsx|cjs|mts|cts` candidates) now serves both `resolveImport` and the
  pub-entrypoint walk — the walk's stale duplicate list (already missing `.tsx/.jsx//index.mjs`,
  so a `main: "./src/index.js"` backed by `src/index.ts` never marked anything `pub`) is gone.
  Direct extensions stay before remaps: the literal on-disk file wins (Node runtime semantics —
  a deliberate, documented divergence from tsc's substitute-first probe order), so every remap is
  a pure recall addition and existing corpora extract byte-identically (A/B-verified against the
  pre-fix resolver). `.mts/.cts` join `SRC_RE` and the JS/TS dispatch points — the remap table
  only means something if those sources are enumerated. Six fixture packages in
  `tests/import-nodenext.test.mjs` (disambiguation, namespace member, re-export chain + barrel
  dependent, `.mjs→.mts` + `/index.tsx`, pub-walk mirror, both-exist precedence pin).
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #11)
- **Bare-ref magnets are gone — parameters stop fabricating cross-role edges.** Measured on the
  self-map: 234 of 1,180 ref edges targeted 8 single-letter test/bench symbols and 209 ref edges
  ran product → non-product, all fabricated from PARAMETERS — refRe scanned declaration lines
  (`function metrics(g) {` emitted a ref from metrics to a test file's global `g`) and body uses
  of params hit the role-blind unique-global fallback. The codebase renamed its own parameters to
  dodge this (`sourceReader`'s `relPath`, import-resolve's `relPathOf/recTextOf/maskTextOf` —
  comments admitting it). Four mechanisms now close the class: (1) refRe skips declaration lines
  (with paren-balance continuation for multi-line signatures; callRe/inherit/instanceof scans
  untouched); (2) a bare name token-bound by the signature of ANY enclosing range never reaches
  the fallback — shadowing semantics, per binding (a call through a param invokes the param's
  value, never the global; `sig.raw` over-collection only ever suppresses fallback edges);
  (3) the unique-global fallback rejects 1–2-char names, counted and surfaced in the banner as
  `(N short-name)` — never silent (the 4 short product symbols all resolve same-file; nothing
  legitimate is lost); (4) ref kinds are role-gated in REJECT form — a product caller whose
  unique in-package def is non-product code drops as ambiguous (filter-form would fabricate a
  product→product edge from a name collision); the gate is deliberately one-directional, the
  missing mirror of the test→product relabel that feeds testIn/coverage. Self-map after: refs
  into ≤2-char symbols 234 → 2 (both same-file refs to a real one-letter bench formatter),
  product→non-product refs 209 → 0, and both rename workarounds are deleted with the natural
  names restored — `tests/self-map-roles.test.mjs` re-extracts the repo and pins the invariant
  plus the exact cycle class the renames dodged; `tests/extract-refscope.test.mjs` isolates each
  mechanism (including the test→product survival pin and the per-binding positive control).
  `SCANNER_VERSION` 14 → 15 so warm caches can't replay pre-fix edges.
  (perf-quality round 2, finding #10)
- **Overlap's Signal B honors the product-role scope its header advertises.** The role filter fed
  Signals A and C (via `defs`), but Signal B's twin candidates came from `outLabels` built over
  ALL graph edges and the twin loop never consulted roles — on the self-map every emitted
  `parallel-impl` finding paired test helpers ("merge the test helpers", the flagship bad advice
  role-scoping was built to kill) while the header claimed those symbols were excluded. One
  caller-side filter on `cand` closes it: both members of every pair come from `cand`, so the
  twin loop, LSH and exact paths are all covered; `considerPair`/jaccard judging is untouched;
  `CODEWEB_ALL_ROLES=1` short-circuits before the role lookup and restores the old scope exactly
  (byte-identical findings, A/B-verified against the pre-fix overlap on the same map — 16
  test-helper pairings on the post-#10/#11 self-map, all excluded by default, ONLY they).
  Signal-B case in `tests/overlap-roles.test.mjs` writes `call`-kind edges directly to exercise
  the caller-side filter. (perf-quality round 2, finding #16)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Warm refreshes stop paying the AST tax (Spec A).** The tree-sitter engine now initializes
  lazily — a cheap availability probe decides cache namespaces and meta stamps up front, and
  the WASM runtime loads only at the first file that actually needs a parse. AST products
  (qualified methods, dispatch edges, exact per-node complexity) ride the scan cache, so a
  warm cached extraction on codeweb itself dropped **1.89s → 0.38s (5×)** with byte-identical
  fragments — felt directly by the MCP auto-refresh, the post-edit hook, and every staleness
  check. The banner now reports the tier's state (`ast: loaded|idle|off`).
- **The AST performance gate finally has a committed verdict**
  (`bench/results/ts-engine-bench.json`): cold extraction costs 3.6–4.3× regex
  (~+1.35 ms/symbol, axios + self) — paid once per changed file — and the warm path is
  engine-free, so default-on stands. Also fixes the bench's regex arm, which had silently
  benchmarked tree-sitter against itself ever since the tier went default-on.
- **The pipeline memoizes its downstream stages (Spec B).** cluster/overlap/optimize/report
  are pure functions of the extracted fragment (+ `CODEWEB_*` levers), so a re-run whose
  fragment is byte-identical reuses their outputs — wall-time changes, never a byte
  (property-tested modulo the `generatedAt` stamp). Extract itself now rides the scan cache
  inside `run.mjs`, making a no-change re-map of codeweb **~0.4s end to end**. `--full`
  forces a recompute.
- **Overlap survives monorepo scale — with declared caps.** Mapping TypeScript's `src/`
  exposed two quadratic passes (overlap sat at 100% CPU for 8+ minutes): all-pairs body
  confirmation inside huge same-name groups, and twin seeding through hub labels with
  thousands of callers. Same-name groups now body-confirm on a deterministic 12-node sample
  (the finding's evidence says so), >50-caller hub labels are excluded from twin seeding, a
  200k global pair budget seeds smallest groups first, and 400+-line bodies shingle their
  first 400 lines — every cap counted in the md header. Deterministic, reported, never silent.
- **Fixed: an input-dependent HANG in the shared tokenizer.** The string-literal regex in
  `lib/shingles.mjs` (`(?:\\.|(?!\1).)*`) backtracked exponentially on unterminated-quote
  content — one lone apostrophe in a big real-world body (TypeScript's testRunner fixtures)
  pinned the whole overlap stage at 100% CPU for 15+ minutes. Replaced with a linear-time
  matcher (each char consumed exactly one way) + a regression test; identical semantics.
  Found by the Spec B scale test; this also protects `find_similar` and the edit-time
  duplication check, which share the tokenizer.
- **The scale verdict is committed** (`bench/results/scale-typescript.json`): TypeScript
  `src/` — 16,286 symbols, 44,640 edges, 709 files including `checker.ts` — maps in **43s
  cold, 4s memoized re-run**, queries answer in ~200ms on the 13.5MB graph, and the top
  findings are real compiler duplication (`substituteExpression` ×9, drifted). On that
  evidence `lib/shards.mjs` is **deleted**: monolithic graphs hold with 10× headroom, the
  sharding layer had zero consumers, and git history keeps it if a 100k-symbol case ever
  materializes.
- **codeweb consolidated itself** (`bench/results/self-campaign.json`): the campaign's three
  product-true merges are executed — `findTarget` (both hooks; the duplication had hidden
  REAL drift, one hook's language list was seven languages stale), `load()` (diff/review →
  the canonical `loadGraph`, with better errors), and `edgeKey` (break-cycles/diff →
  graph-ops, NUL-separated collision-safe variant). Before/after gate: −22 nodes, −2
  duplication findings, coupling −25, **zero structural regressions**. The 65 DELETE steps
  are honestly skipped as false orphans (walker closures dispatched through function tables —
  exactly the `--orphans` cross-check caveat, applied to ourselves).
- **`npm run bench:all` — the standing benchmark suite behind every published number**
  (Spec C): pipeline timings, a representative 12-call MCP session (bytes/≈tokens/validity),
  per-tool response budgets, and the ts-engine gate, written to `bench/results/benchmarks.json`
  (+ a site mirror). A new CI job runs it with `--gate`: budgets live in `bench/budgets.json`,
  and breaking one fails the build. `check-consistency` now also audits that every evidence
  source cited by the ledger and README exists — claims physically can't rot.
- **Replay A/B gains cost-to-coverage (Spec D).** The workflow runs cells sequentially and
  records each cell's true token cost from the harness's own `budget.spent()` deltas (never
  solver self-report); the analyzer reports per-condition means and `costToFullCoverageTokens`
  — the discriminator when both arms hit the coverage ceiling. Old cells without cost report
  null and are counted, not fabricated. **Corpus v3 is frozen** after nine mining runs across
  six repos (funnels committed as `bench/results/replay-mine-*.json`): the miner re-derived
  the v2 task independently at a wider follow-up window (identical answer key — the instrument
  reproduces its own ground truth), one new 4-caller candidate was rejected under
  hand-verification (a feature-PR rewrite mentioning the symbol, not a caller fix), and the
  corpus stays at one fully-verified task — honestly. True-breakage tasks are rare; that is
  the finding.
- **Role overrides (Spec E).** `codeweb.rules.json` gains `roles: [{glob, role}]` — heuristics
  can't know a repo's private layout, so the repo says it once and extraction honors it (first
  match wins, invalid roles fail loudly, absent config is byte-identical to before). codeweb's
  own config marks `docs/**` as `generated` (it's the built website), completing the
  vite-playground precision lesson on our own map.
- **Python, Go, and Rust join the dispatch tier (Spec F).** Three vendored pinned grammars +
  dedicated tree walkers wire the calls regex precision-gates away: `self.m()`/`cls.m()`,
  Go receiver methods, Rust `self.m()`, and typed-receiver calls (`p: Pipe`, `q Pipe`,
  `p: &Pipe`) resolved globally under the one-owner rule — ambiguity drops and is counted,
  never guessed. Nodes stay byte-identical between engines; products ride the scan cache.
- **Caller-reliance contracts v2 (Spec G).** The explain card (and the ambient pre-edit card)
  now also reports: callers that try/catch or `.catch()` the symbol ("thrown types are
  contract"), callees that mutate a named parameter ("callers share that object"), and callers
  that null-check the result ("keep null/undefined returns possible"). Same conservatism as
  v1 — line-visible evidence or no claim.
- **Type-3 (near-miss) clone detection (Spec H).** The AST tier fingerprints each function's
  statements (identifier/literal-normalized, order-independent multiset); overlap pairs bodies
  sharing ≥70% of them — reordered or lightly-edited copies the exact and Type-2 passes cannot
  see. A distinct `near-miss-clone` finding kind, REVIEW-only by construction, bounded and
  deterministic.
- **Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, and Swift on the deterministic fast path (Spec I)** — eleven native
  languages. Discovery with owner-qualified methods (Ruby `def self.`, Kotlin extension
  `fun Type.name`, Swift `extension` members), visibility-as-export per language's own rules,
  comment/string masking, precision-gated calls, test-role detection (`spec/`, `_spec.rb`,
  `*Test.php`, `*Tests.swift`), and package manifests (Gemfile, composer.json, Package.swift).
  Verified on sinatra (1,173 symbols), monolog (1,622), okio (3,874, mixed Kotlin+Java),
  and Alamofire (2,616) — zero keyword phantoms, deterministic.
- **The report closes the loop to the editor (Spec J).** The inspector shows `Open in editor`
  (`vscode://file/...`) once the viewer supplies their project root — stored in localStorage,
  client-side only, because the shipped report still never embeds the absolute source path
  (the standing privacy invariant, now pinned by a second test).
- **npm + VS Code distribution, prepared (Spec J).** The package is publish-ready (`codeweb` +
  `codeweb-mcp` bins with shebangs, files whitelist, LICENSE, zero runtime deps — verified by
  an `npm pack` test); the release workflow builds and attaches the `.vsix` to every GitHub
  Release and carries npm/Marketplace publish steps that no-op until `NPM_TOKEN`/`VSCE_PAT`
  are configured. Publishing stays a human decision; the prep is done.

### Changed
- **The paper program is archived; the receipts stay.** `paper/` is retired from `main`:
  the runnable instruments and every frozen result (nulls and the discarded pilot included)
  now live in **`bench/`** as the product's benchmark suite (`bench/README.md`,
  `node bench/run-all.mjs`), and the site's Paper page is gone — the evidence ledger on the
  Research page (now including the 2026 blind replay A/B null) plus the CHANGELOG's Research
  notes are the public record. The manuscript, pre-registration (H1–H18), and figure
  apparatus remain in git history, last present at tag `v0.8.0`. README and ROADMAP
  rewritten to point at receipts instead of the manuscript.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Java and C# call wiring (tree-sitter dispatch tier).** The regex engine still finds every
  symbol; for Java/C# files an optional AST pass now adds the call edges regex could never
  claim safely: `this.helper()` calls inside a class, and `receiver.method()` calls where the
  receiver's declared type names exactly one class in the repo (two classes with the same name
  → the edge is dropped and counted in the banner, never guessed). Nodes are untouched —
  identical between engines — so determinism holds. Grammars vendored from
  `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@0.3.1` (`scripts/grammars/PROVENANCE.md` records the ABI trap that
  rules out the older grammar package). Spec: `docs/specs/java-cs-tree-sitter.md`.
- **The ledger now counts whether advice was FOLLOWED, not just delivered.** When a pre-edit
  card names caller files and a later edit in the same session touches one of them (30-minute
  window, once per file, the changed symbol's own file excluded), the ledger bumps
  `cardCallersFollowed` and the session brief reports "N card-named caller(s) followed" —
  the difference between "we showed advice" and "the advice changed what happened."
  Spec: `docs/specs/card-correlation.md`.

### Research
- **The replay miner is tested and honest about its funnel.** `paper/experiments/replay-mine.mjs`
  (mines real commits that changed a function's definition and — per the repo's own later
  fixes — missed caller files) gained a TDD suite on synthetic git histories
  (`tests/replay-mine.test.mjs`, P1–P5) and a stage-by-stage funnel report. The tests + a
  hand-audit of the first frozen corpus exposed and fixed three miner bugs: a prefilter that
  silently zeroed every Java/C# candidate, a raw def-line comparison that read a prettier
  reformat as a "signature change" (which had produced 2 invalid tasks), and instructions
  truncated mid-hunk at 4KB (now: complete-or-rejected). Spec: `docs/specs/replay-corpus.md`.
- **The replay A/B protocol went blind before spending.** The v1 pilot leaked its own answer
  key three ways (the grading list pasted into solver prompts, self-reported coverage, and
  full-history isolation that let solvers read the historical fix commit). It is preserved —
  discarded — in `paper/results/replay-ab-pilot.json`; the v2 harness solves in a
  history-free export of the base revision and the workflow itself computes coverage as
  `filesChanged ∩ missedByChange`. Spec amendments: `docs/specs/replay-run.md`.
- **Replay A/B result: both arms at ceiling (honest null).** The v2 corpus froze at ONE
  fully-verified task — axios `buildFullPath` gaining `allowAbsoluteUrls`, where the real 2025
  change missed 2 of its 3 caller files and axios needed two follow-up PRs (#6810, #6814).
  Blind-replayed 4× per arm: all 8 cells covered both missed files with 0 structural
  regressions — with or without codeweb. On a 3-caller single-package change, a capable
  agent's grep saturates; the historical miss does not reproduce, so ambient context is
  bounded near zero **on this task shape**. The run proves the instrument (leak-free,
  fixed-function grading, ambient engagement verified in every treatment cell — the card's
  caller list matched ground truth exactly) and shows guarded mining makes true breakage
  tasks RARE: 2 of 3 v1 tasks and the only new candidate died under scrutiny. Discriminating
  between the arms needs many-caller cross-package tasks or cost-to-coverage metrics —
  recorded as the corpus growth path. Full data: `paper/results/replay-ab{,-raw}.json`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **README screenshots crop to content.** The regenerated shots were uniform full-page
  frames — squeezed into README boxes, the matrix rendered ~170px wide and the blast
  shot's inspector was unreadable. `scripts/screenshot.mjs` now crops each frame to what
  it shows: the graph to its drawn bounding box, the blast shot to the LIT selection
  (tracked from the draw pass) + inspector at a tighter zoom, the matrix to its table +
  legend. README display sizes and the stale corpus line ("274 symbols across 8
  domains" → the real 334/11) synced; shots remain one-command regenerable.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed (the report finally looks like the product it is)
- **A validated color system replaces generated hues.** Area colors were `hsl(i × 137.5°)` —
  unbounded spun hues; the treemap ramped green→red at full saturation (measured deutan
  ΔE 2.2 — invisible to red-green-deficient viewers). Now: a fixed-order 8-slot categorical
  palette validated against the actual dark surface (worst adjacent ΔE 8.4 protan / 19.3
  normal, all ≥3:1; 9th+ areas fold to neutral), a single-hue slate→red lightness ramp for
  duplication density (with an on-canvas legend), reserved status colors for finding
  severity, and the brand lime demoted to what it should be: UI accent (selection, focus),
  never a data series.
- **The graph is drawn like a product.** Focus + context replaces expand-everything: every
  area starts as a bubble and clicking one expands ITS symbols in place — the all-at-once
  hairball is impossible unless explicitly asked for. Curved weight-scaled edges; node fills
  with darker same-hue rings; halo labels in the real UI font (the canvas font stack fell
  back to a serif before); the tangle color only appears where it means something; search
  reveals a hidden symbol's area instead of saying "no matches"; positions persist across
  expansions; layout is seeded — the same repo always draws the same map.
- **Treemap/matrix polish**: cell gaps + rounded corners, styled area headers with color
  chips, readable in-cell numbers (they were dark-on-dark), chip legends instead of prose.
- **First paint earns its pixels**: the inspector opens with the repo overview (largest
  areas, findings counts, how-to-read) instead of "Pick an item"; engine jargon moved out
  of the masthead into a tooltip; a logomark anchors the header.
- **Deterministic demo shots** (`scripts/screenshot.mjs`): staged states (top hotspot
  selected, its area expanded, inspector populated) at 2× retina with fixed framing — every
  committed screenshot (`assets/screens/`) regenerates from the real report in one command.
  The live demo (`docs/demo/`) rebuilt on the new template.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **The local outcome ledger** (`scripts/stats.mjs`, `npm run stats`): codeweb now counts what
  it actually does during real work — session briefs injected, pre-edit cards delivered,
  post-edit checks run, regressions flagged before landing, queries served, auto-refreshes —
  written by the hooks and the MCP server beside the graph (`stats.json`). Strictly local
  (never transmitted; counter names + integers only; `CODEWEB_NO_STATS=1` disables), fail-open
  by construction. The brief carries a one-line receipt ("codeweb this month: …") — the value
  made visible where it accrued.

### Research
- **Evidence program moves into the product** (`paper/STATUS.md`): the manuscript is frozen as
  a reproducible artifact; claims live in the site's evidence ledger + these Research notes.
- **Replay benchmark** (`paper/experiments/replay-mine.mjs` + `replay-ab.workflow.js`): mine
  git history for commits that changed a depended-on signature and provably missed caller
  files a later commit had to fix — each hit is a task with a built-in answer key (no invented
  tasks, no floor effect). First verified mining run on axios (1,647 commits, funnel reported
  at every stage): 2 ground-truth tasks, e.g. `forEach` — 9 caller files, 8 missed, fixed in a
  follow-up. The replay workflow runs control vs ambient codeweb over the mined set, graded on
  historical-miss coverage + the deterministic gate.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added (fewer mistakes per token)
- **Day-one briefing** (`codeweb_brief`, 24th MCP tool + `scripts/brief.mjs` + a SessionStart
  hook): one ~2KB page — areas with summaries, the most depended-on symbols, entry points
  (heuristic), test layout, known issues — injected automatically when a session starts in a
  mapped repo. Replaces the first 20-50k tokens of exploratory orientation with pre-computed
  answers; served in-process from the cached graph.
- **Caller-reliance contracts** (`lib/reliance.mjs`): the explain card (and therefore the
  pre-edit hook, which embeds its summary) now reads the actual call sites and says what
  callers depend on — destructured/member-accessed result fields ("callers use {timeout,
  retries} — keep those"), awaited fraction, and the argument-count range in use. Targets the
  most common breaking edit: changing a return shape a caller still destructures.
  Conservative: only call-site-line patterns count; no sites → no claim.
- **Confidence calibration** (extractor v10): symbols reachable from a package entrypoint
  (package.json main/module/browser/bin/exports, followed through named + star re-export
  chains) are stamped `pub` — "0 in-repo callers" on a public symbol now answers with
  "⚠ public API — external callers likely; renames are breaking" instead of false confidence.
  Files using dynamic dispatch (computed member calls, getattr, non-literal require, emitters)
  are recorded in `meta.dynamic`, and empty callers/dependents answers cite them ("absence of
  callers is weaker evidence"). Confident answers stay caveat-free — no noise.

### Research
- **H18-v2 prepped** (`paper/experiments/agent-ab2-ambient.workflow.js` + `agent-ab2.README.md`):
  the agent A/B rerun as one funded command — v1's null was a floor effect (both arms ~0
  regressions on easy tasks), so v2 pre-registers hard tasks (graph-verified fan-in ≥ 5 /
  shape changes) and an AMBIENT treatment arm mirroring what the hooks now inject (brief +
  explain cards with reliance/caveats — context delivered, not offered). The analyzer takes
  raw/out paths so v1 results stay frozen.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Java + C# on the deterministic fast path** (extractor v8): class/interface/enum/
  record/struct discovery with visibility-as-export, owner-qualified method ids
  (constructors included), Allman-brace + expression-bodied members (C#), `extends` /
  base-list inheritance edges, control-flow phantom guards, Maven/Gradle test-layout
  and `*Test.java` / `*Tests.cs` role detection, and pom.xml / build.gradle / .csproj
  package boundaries. Verified on square/javapoet (497 symbols, 0 phantoms, 0.7s) and
  restsharp/RestSharp (1,542 symbols, Allman style, 0.9s). Method-dispatch recall
  (`obj.Method()`) stays precision-gated as in the JS regex tier — a tree-sitter tier
  for Java/C# is the next increment.

### Added (recall ceiling + ambient loop)
- **Tree-sitter tier default-on** when web-tree-sitter is installed (`--engine regex`
  opts out; absent dependency degrades to regex byte-identically). Class-field arrow
  methods survive the AST handoff.
- **Barrels are dependents** (the measured recall gap): `export { X } from` edges the
  barrel's `<module>` to the resolved symbol; `export * from` chains resolve
  transitively AND edge the barrel to the target module. Oracle A/B moved from
  recall 0.94 to **1.00** (precision 0.94 vs grep 0.87) on both the fixed and a
  fresh-seeded 30-task sample.
- **Ambient loop**: the pre-edit hook now injects the ~1KB explain card (identity, top
  callers, tests) instead of a pointer — blast radius arrives with zero agent
  discipline; the MCP server **auto-refreshes a stale graph inline** (~1s incremental,
  throttled, CODEWEB_NO_AUTOREFRESH=1 opts out) before structural queries, and
  per-DIRECTORY mtime stamps make brand-new files trip the staleness check (per-file
  stamps cannot see a file that didn't exist).

### Added (the proof, the surfaces, the last query family)
- **`codeweb bench`** (`scripts/bench.mjs`, `npm run bench`): the oracle A/B packaged as a
  one-command benchmark on YOUR repo — context cost per dependents task + blast-radius cost
  always; recall/precision graded by the TypeScript LanguageService when `typescript` is
  resolvable; ripgrep optional. The engine moved verbatim into `scripts/lib/bench-core.mjs`
  (the paper experiment is now a thin wrapper over it — reproduction against the committed
  canonical run is byte-identical), so published numbers and user-generated numbers can
  never measure different things.
- **The gate now posts its review**: `ci-gate --md` renders the structural delta (blocking
  regressions, new cycles/duplications, symbols that lost all callers, renames-not-churn)
  as a budgeted digest and the `codeweb gate` workflow posts/updates it as a sticky PR
  comment on pass AND fail — visible where reviewers already look, verdict unchanged.
- **Editor CodeLens** (`editor/vscode-codeweb`): zero-dependency VS Code extension showing
  `N callers · blast M` above every mapped symbol from the nearest `.codeweb/graph.json`
  (identical semantics to `codeweb_callers`/`codeweb_impact`), click-through to
  `report.html#s=<id>`.
- **`codeweb_find` — concept search** (23rd MCP tool + `scripts/find.mjs`): free text
  ("where is retry handled?") → ranked symbols, deterministically — camelCase/snake_case
  token match with light stemming over identifiers/files/domains, weighted by exports,
  role (tests only when asked for), and fan-in. Served in-process from the cached graph,
  budgeted, staleness-annotated. Closes the last gap: every other query tool needs a name;
  this one turns an idea into the right starting symbol.

### Research
- **Oracle A/B** (`paper/experiments/oracle-ab.mjs`, results in
  `paper/results/oracle-ab.json`): dependents-discovery graded by the TypeScript
  compiler's own reference finder over 30 seeded vite symbols — codeweb recall 0.94 /
  precision 0.89 at **1/3 of an idealized grep's context cost** (0.8KB vs 2.5KB per
  task); blast-radius ("what transitively breaks") in one ~1KB call vs a recursive
  grep loop's ~130KB (**126× on the canonical run**, simulated generously for grep). Mechanical and
  reproducible — complements (does not replace) the frozen frontier-agent pilot,
  whose run stays the evidence for agent-loop behavior (+0.27 recall, ~44% fewer
  tokens). The 6/30 under-recalled symbols are the known dispatch/re-export gap.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

The agent-efficiency release: outputs that can't corrupt, answers that fit a context
window, and a map that tells you when it's stale. Driven by the measured product review
(`PRODUCT-REVIEW.md`).

### Fixed
- **Flush-safe output everywhere**: `process.exit()` after a large stdout write silently
  truncated anything past the 64KB pipe buffer (piped CLI JSON cut at exactly 65,536
  bytes; MCP responses clipped mid-string). All CLIs now end naturally via
  `lib/cli.mjs` emitters; `| head` (EPIPE) exits cleanly.
- `run.mjs` resolves a relative `<SRC>` against the caller's cwd (it resolved against the
  plugin root while `--out-dir` used the cwd) and reports stage failures in one clean
  line instead of a raw `execFileSync` stack. `--open` is parsed and forwarded (it was
  documented but inert).
- Campaign delete steps ranked ROI 0: `deadcode` now emits `loc` per item and the
  planner reads it (`locSaved` stays as a legacy alias).
- Same-file same-name methods collided into one node id: v6/v7 extraction emits
  owner-qualified ids (`file:Type.method`) in every tier (Python classes, Rust impls,
  Go receivers, JS/TS classes), with member-access resolution following.
- Body spans no longer desync on multi-line template literals / block comments (bodies
  swallowed whole neighboring functions — a 5-line helper recorded as 550 loc on vite,
  poisoning complexity, context-pack, and body-confirmation). Extents are measured on
  masked lines.
- `mcp-server` advertised version 0.1.0 on a 0.2.0 product; `serverInfo.version` now
  derives from package.json and `check-consistency` audits it.
- Signal-B twins de-duplicate by label pair (several `<module>` nodes produced N
  byte-identical findings).

### Added
- **Budgeted MCP responses**: list-heavy tools default to a one-line `summary` + top-N
  most-relevant items + TRUE totals + explicit `more.remaining`; `full: true` or
  `limit`/`offset` override. `codeweb_context` returns call-site windows (±3 lines)
  instead of whole caller bodies (~300KB → ~10KB on a busy vite symbol).
- **`codeweb_map`**: build/rebuild the graph over MCP; `graph` becomes
  optional on every tool (nearest `.codeweb/graph.json` above cwd, or `CODEWEB_WS`),
  and a missing graph returns an actionable error naming the fix.
- **`codeweb_explain`**: one ~1KB card (identity, contract, dependents, blast radius,
  findings) answering "tell me about X" — previously 3-4 calls. 22 tools total.
- **Plugin auto-registration**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` now carries `mcpServers`,
  so `/plugin install codeweb` delivers the tools without a manual `claude mcp add`.
- **Code roles**: every node carries `role` (product|test|fixture|example|bench|
  generated). Overlap findings, deadcode tiers, and the report's default view scope to
  product code (`CODEWEB_ALL_ROLES=1` / an in-report toggle widen it).
- **Interface-pattern detection**: ≥4 same-named implementations that nothing in-repo
  calls demote from "merge these" to an informational `interface-pattern` finding
  (framework hooks like a bundler plugin's `resolveId()`).
- **Workspace scoping**: bare-name call resolution never crosses a package (manifest)
  boundary — cross-package name collisions no longer fabricate edges in monorepos.
- **Staleness awareness**: the extractor stamps per-file size+mtime into
  `meta.sources`; query/context results annotate when the graph no longer matches disk
  and point at `codeweb_refresh`.
- **Pre-edit hook**: one advisory line of blast radius before an edit lands in a mapped
  target (PreToolUse; fail-open). The post-edit hook re-extracts incrementally
  (`--cache`) instead of full-scanning per edit.
- Bare-identifier arguments become `ref` edges (a callback passed is a reference, not an
  invocation); class-field arrow methods (`handleClick = () => {}`) are discovered and
  owner-qualified.
- Report: product-only filter, interface-pattern section, search that navigates
  (Enter cycles + selects matches), `#s=<id>` deep links, keyboard/ARIA support, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` (layout settles without animation).
- `lib/cli.mjs`: the shared CLI harness (die/emit/loadGraph/capList/staleness) —
  deleting the die()×16 / graph-load×13 duplication codeweb's own overlap report flagged.

- **In-process query serving**: the MCP server answers structural queries from a
  cached parsed graph (4–6ms vs 75–122ms spawn+parse), via the same
  `lib/query-core.mjs` the CLI ships — one truth, two transports.
- **Rename-aware diff**: a removed+added pair with an identifier-normalized
  (Type-2) body match ≥85% reports as `renamed[]` instead of delete+add churn.
- Domain summaries are genuinely descriptive: size, file count, exported-first
  key symbols, and role composition ("mostly test code").

### Changed
- `campaign` batches its delete simulation (one clone instead of one per step):
  8.9s → 1.25s on a 3k-symbol monorepo.
- MCP `initialize` returns workflow `instructions` and negotiates a SUPPORTED protocol
  version instead of echoing arbitrary client strings; tool calls get a 120s timeout.
- `codeweb_find_similar` accepts `body` (stdin plumbing) + `structural` over MCP;
  `codeweb_review` accepts `before` + `gate`; `codeweb_reading_order` accepts
  scope/value/budget — previously CLI-only capability, now agent-reachable.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-23

The first managed release: codeweb gets a real public front and the machinery to keep
product, marketing, and research in lock-step.

### Added

- **Public website** built from a zero-dependency Node builder (`site/build.mjs`) into
  `docs/` — Home, Product, Research, Get Started, and Changelog pages, all self-contained
  with zero third-party requests, served by GitHub Pages.
- **Design system** (`site/tokens.css` + `site/styles.css`): the engine's palette codified
  into reusable tokens and components, plus a polished animated hero.
- **Evidence ledger** on the Research page — every claim tagged `Validated`,
  `Preliminary`, or `Null` with its exact number, sample size, and source file.
- **Single source of truth** (`site/data/product.json`) for the tagline, the 20 MCP tools,
  the Tier 0–3 map, supported languages, and the claim ledger.
- **Release ecosystem**: this `CHANGELOG.md`, plus `scripts/version-sync.mjs`,
  `scripts/check-consistency.mjs`, and `scripts/release.mjs`.
- Shared navigation injected into the existing interactive demo and research paper, so
  they are no longer orphaned pages.

### Changed

- Corrected the Claude Code plugin manifest, which advertised **15** query tools; the real
  surface is **20**. The tool count is now derived from the MCP server and verified in CI.
- README updated for the new site, version, and a `Versioning & Releases` section.

### Fixed

- Per-page Open Graph metadata and favicon (the Pages root previously 404'd — there was no
  landing page at all).

### Research

- Surfaced the **efficiency pilot**: frontier-agent caller discovery improves by
  **+0.265 ± 0.045** recall and **~34% fewer steps** vs grep over 8 engine-frozen reps
  (`paper/experiments/efficiency-pilot.reps8.json`). Labelled preliminary.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

The deterministic engine and its evidence base.

### Added

- **Core pipeline** — extract → cluster → overlap → render: a parse-free, zero-dependency
  code-structure graph with a self-contained interactive `report.html`.
- **Ten features across four tiers** (F1–F10): scoped context, live refresh, the
  duplication-delta gate, hotspots, campaign planning, structural clone detection,
  suppression memory, reading order, incremental edge derivation, and sharded subgraphs.
- **20 deterministic MCP tools** spanning structural queries, write-time, review-time,
  optimize-time, freshness, and comparison.
- **Five-language fast path**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Go.
- **CI gate** — a GitHub Action that fails a PR on a new cycle, a new duplication, or a
  symbol that loses all callers.

### Research

- **Pre-registered effectiveness study** — 32 of 33 checks pass; 0 disagreements across
  ~490k oracle comparisons; the study found and fixed two real engine bugs the 286-test
  suite had missed (`paper/`).
