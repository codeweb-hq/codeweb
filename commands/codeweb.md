description: Dissect a codebase into atomic nodes, wire the system web, tag domains, and surface overlap/consolidation opportunities as an interactive HTML map. Works on the current project or an external repo (path or git URL).

# /codeweb

Use the **codebase-anatomy** skill to build a symbol relationship map and an overlap graph.
Use the results to plan restructuring work.

## Usage

```
/codeweb [target] [flags]
```

- `target` — a local path (default: current directory `.`) **or** a git URL / `owner/repo`
  to clone read-only and review before adopting.
- `--depth module|symbol|auto` — granularity (default `auto`: module-level overview, then
  symbol-level on the densest/most-overlapping subsystems).
- `--engine hybrid|read|tools` — how edges are extracted (default `hybrid`: static-analysis
  tools when available, agent reading otherwise).
- `--focus <glob>` — restrict atomic dissection to a path glob (e.g. `src/payments/**`).
- `--mode internal|external` — `internal` = restructure my own code; `external` = explore a
  third-party repo and produce an adoption review. Auto-detected from `target` if omitted.
- `--open` — open the generated `report.html` after rendering.

## What it does

1. Scopes and acquires the target (clones external repos read-only; never executes their code).
2. Dissects the code to atomic nodes (functions, classes, methods, exported symbols).
3. Wires the relationship web (calls, imports, inheritance) using the hybrid engine.
4. Tags every node with a semantic domain and clusters the domains.
5. Builds the overlap graph — duplicated logic, parallel implementations, tangled domains —
   and ranks consolidation opportunities.
6. Runs the consolidation advisor — tiers each duplicate-logic finding into **ready** (a
   body-confirmed merge the regression gate would accept), **blocked** (a merge that would
   introduce a new dependency cycle), or **review** (drifted/structural) — and writes `optimize.md`.
7. Renders a self-contained interactive HTML map plus `graph.json`, `overlap.md`, and `optimize.md`.
8. In external mode, adds an adoption review (risk, dependency, architecture verdict).

## Instructions for Claude

Activate the `codebase-anatomy` skill and follow its workflow. Parse the options above from
`$ARGUMENTS`. Use **external mode** when `target` is a Git URL or `owner/repo`, unless the user
selects a different mode.

Use the deterministic **fast path** for the thirteen native languages: JavaScript, TypeScript,
Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, C, and C++. Run this command:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run.mjs" "<target>" --target "<label>" --out-dir "<target>/.codeweb"
```

The command runs extract → cluster → overlap → optimize → render. Pass `--open` and
`--allow-empty` through to the command.

Use agent-based dissection for a language outside the native list or when the user selects
`--engine read`. The `--depth`, `--focus`, and `--engine` options control this fallback. The fast
path always maps the complete target at symbol depth and produces deterministic output.

Write outputs under `<target>/.codeweb/`. Use a temporary directory for a cloned external
repository. Report each artifact path and the highest-ranked consolidation opportunities. Report
the **ready** tier from `optimize.md` first, and then report each item that a projected cycle
**blocked**.
