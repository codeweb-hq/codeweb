// Text pins on CHARTER.md's ratified governance, in the same spirit as workflows.test.mjs: the
// regression class is a ruling QUIETLY REVERTING — a non-goal restored, an amendment's date or
// operator attribution dropped in an edit, a struck rule drifting back to live prose. The charter
// is the file every other surface is audited against (`CLAUDE.md`, the 150 · Drift Audit), so a
// silent change here launders itself into README/site copy with nothing failing.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: the 2026-08-17/18 amendment (A1-A4) plus the two disciplines the
// charter states about ITSELF (dated+attributed entries, one question at a time). Wording is not
// pinned — the markers and the decisions are.
