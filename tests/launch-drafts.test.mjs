// Text pins for the committed launch drafts (reports/launch/).
//
// A launch post is the highest-scrutiny, lowest-context surface this project has: a number lands
// in front of readers who have no way to check it and no framing around it. The regression class
// is therefore narrower than "the number is wrong" — it is A NUMBER WITHOUT A MISSION-FRESH
// RECEIPT: a figure carried over from a pre-mission run, a value that drifted away from the
// artifact after a re-run, or one of the charter-barred claims (C7 cost premise, C3 two-modes,
// C4 price/SLA, the unframed 126x) reappearing in copy nobody re-reads before sending.
//
// Wording stays free. What is pinned: every number in the drafts is a key in receipts.md's table,
// every table value still equals what the committed artifact records, every cited artifact is
// mission-fresh (regenerated after the 2026-08-17 window opened), and none of the barred claims
// appear.
