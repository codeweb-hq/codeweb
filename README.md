**Structural checks for AI code changes.** codeweb's gate builds
the call graph before and after a change, then fails the pull request on three regressions: a new
dependency cycle, a new body-confirmed duplication, or an existing non-exported symbol that
becomes an orphan with no mapped callers. [Gate conditions and limits](docs/ci-gate.md).

No LLM is in the checks. The gate uses zero model tokens for its static analysis.
A passing check does not prove the program works. Analysis can miss dynamic relationships;
inspect unresolved results and run the relevant tests. Pure removals pass the structural rules.

The verdict uses the mapped graph, not a model, and costs zero LLM tokens. Exported symbols are exempt
from the diff’s orphan check. Inspect `analysis.checks`: skipped
checks are not passes, and refresh drops the evidence needed to evaluate duplication.

A green result does not establish complete dependency coverage or behavioral correctness.
Pure removals do not count as structural regressions.
[Put it on your PRs →](#gate-every-pull-request)

The gate needs a map to compare, and that map is worth reading on its own.

codeweb reads your code. It maps supported functions and the calls it can resolve between them. It maps
3,000 symbols in approximately 3 seconds. Static analysis produces the same map from the
same code. No LLM is in the mapping loop.

Static extraction can omit unsupported layouts,
ambiguous calls, and runtime dispatch; the map is not a completeness guarantee.

Your coding agents query the map instead of using grep. In measured tests, agents that used grep
missed more than half of a function's real callers
([see the measurements](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/research.html)). An incomplete caller
list can cause an agent to break code that it did not inspect.

- **Give agents structural data:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides 28 tools,
  including `codeweb_impact`, `codeweb_callers`, and `codeweb_find_similar`.
- **Keep answers small:** Each query returns a bounded structural answer. Your agents can use
  their remaining context for implementation work.
- **Inspect the same data:** The interactive report shows the extracted codebase map.

The map also shows relationships that are not visible in one file. These relationships include
**duplicated logic, dead code, hotspots, and tangled domains**.

## Gate every pull request

From a Codeweb source checkout, run the verdict locally; the GitHub Action can run it on every pull request:

```
node scripts/ci-gate.mjs --base origin/main --target src   # exit 1 on a structural regression
```

The gate builds the graph from the pull request base and from its head, then diffs them. It posts
a sticky structural review comment either way, so reviewers see the blast radius without
installing anything.

**Pin the Action to a release tag**, not a moving branch: a floating ref can change your gate's
verdict semantics under you. Pin `codeweb-ref` to the same tag so the engine is fixed too. The
workflow YAML, the monorepo matrix form, and every input live in
[`docs/ci-gate.md`](docs/ci-gate.md).

Want the gate hosted — no workflow YAML, cached base graphs, and history across every repo in the
org? That is the planned scope of [codeweb Teams](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/pricing.html), the paid half of
[the boundary](#free-forever-and-where-the-paid-line-sits). Running it yourself stays free forever.

## See it in action

Each screenshot below shows a generated report for **axios** (280 symbols, 7 domains).
The screenshots are not mockups.

codeweb found 3 real duplications in axios and rejected 12 false positives. Read
[the case study](docs/case-study-axios.md), or
[inspect the live map](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/demo/).

### Know what an edit breaks — before you write

Select a function in the [live map](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/). The map highlights
the function's **blast radius** and shows the symbols that the change can affect.

Your agents can get the same answer from the `codeweb_impact` MCP tool before they edit the code.

### Navigate the whole system

The force-directed map shows the extracted symbols. You can collapse symbols into domains. Search, drag,
zoom, or select a node to trace its callers and dependencies.

codeweb works at **symbol resolution**. It maps functions, classes, methods, and the call and
import edges between them. A file-level scanner can show that two modules are similar. codeweb
can show that two functions do the same work, identify their callers, and calculate the effect of
a merge.

## Benchmarks

- **Find callers before an edit:** In the v0.9.0 efficiency pilot, agents found **74%** of a
  function's real callers with codeweb and **44%** with grep at the same context spend. A missed
  caller can cause an edit to break working code.
- **Calculate the effect of a change:** One codeweb call returned one small answer. A simulated
  graph-assisted grep loop used **126 times the context size** in the recorded comparison.
  This measures context-size differences, not total agent-session token savings.
- **Detect duplicate code:** codeweb found **every planted duplicate with zero false alarms**,
  including renamed copies. Text search found 0% of the renamed copies.
- **Check deterministic results:** Tests compared codeweb with the TypeScript compiler and other
  independent implementations more than **490,000 times, with zero disagreements**.
- **Map and query quickly:** The first map takes approximately **3 seconds** for a repository with
  3,000 symbols. Queries take approximately **0.1 seconds**. A repository with twice as many
  symbols takes approximately 1.3 times as long to map.
- **Understand the limits:** A new map after a very large edit can take more time. Agents also
  completed simple tasks successfully without codeweb.

Methodology, raw data, and per-claim receipts:
[the evidence ledger](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/research.html). Benchmark your own
repo from a Codeweb source checkout: `npm run bench -- <path>/.codeweb/graph.json`. CI re-runs the performance budgets on
every PR; breaking a published number fails the build.

codeweb also keeps a local activity tally. From a Codeweb source checkout, run `npm run stats` to see it:

```
codeweb this month: 41 pre-edit card(s) · 5 card-named caller(s) followed · 2 regression(s) flagged · 120 queries served
```

To evaluate a dependency, point codeweb at a repository that you do not own:
`/codeweb https://github.com/owner/repo`. codeweb makes a read-only clone, maps the clone, and
adds an adoption review. codeweb does not execute the target code.

## Install

**Free & MIT-licensed. Runs entirely on your machine — no account, no server, no telemetry. Reads
your code; never executes it.**

- codeweb requires **Node.js ≥ 22**.
- codeweb has zero required dependencies. CI verifies operation with an empty `node_modules`
  directory.
- The optional `web-tree-sitter` wasm grammar improves extraction. codeweb does not require it.
- CI publishes releases with **npm provenance**. Run `npm audit signatures` to verify a release.

**Using Claude Code?** Install the plugin to add the `/codeweb` command, automatic pre-edit
impact cards, and all 28 tools:
```
/plugin marketplace add GhostlyGawd/codeweb
/plugin install codeweb
```
Restart Claude Code to register the `/codeweb` command, agents, and skill.

**Using Codex?** Install the bundled coding skill and local MCP server:
```bash
codex plugin marketplace add GhostlyGawd/codeweb
codex plugin add codeweb@codeweb
```
Reload Codex, then use `$codeweb` to inspect callers before an edit, compare existing
implementations, or review a structural change. The plugin uses your existing tool permissions.

The plugin/MCP workflow is verified with Codex CLI 0.159.2 and 0.160.0. If a client does not expose
bundled tools, use the standalone MCP recipe below with the coding skill. Manage each configured
entry when disabling or removing Codeweb. This workflow does not claim automatic hook delivery.

**Choose your MCP client:** [The setup page](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/start.html#other-clients)
provides one recipe for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, or Codex. Print a recipe
and check local setup from your project:

```bash
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb setup --client cursor
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb doctor
```

Setup prints configuration without replacing files. Doctor checks the local server and graph;
a successful local check does not prove an editor connection. Restart your client, ask your
agents to run `codeweb_callers`, and check a returned source location.

**Map a repository without an AI agent:** Run one command from your project directory:
```
cd your-project
npx -y @ghostlygawd/codeweb .    # ~3 s for 3,000 symbols — then open .codeweb/report.html
```

For a temporary evaluation, use the `npx` command. It creates the map without a permanent
installation.

**Run the engine from a clone:**
```
git clone https://github.com/GhostlyGawd/codeweb.git
node codeweb/scripts/run.mjs /path/to/your/project
```

[`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) lists each executable, flag, and exit code.

**VS Code:** [`editor/vscode-codeweb`](editor/vscode-codeweb/) shows an
**`N callers · blast M`** lens above each mapped symbol. Select the lens to open the report.

## Use

```
/codeweb                                  # map the current project
/codeweb src/payments --depth symbol      # deep-dive one subsystem
/codeweb https://github.com/owner/repo    # external review before adopting
/codeweb owner/repo --open                # clone, map, and open the report
```

Available flags include `--depth module|symbol|auto`, `--engine hybrid|read|tools`,
`--focus <glob>`, `--mode internal|external`, and `--open`. See `commands/codeweb.md` for details.

codeweb writes all outputs to `<target>/.codeweb/`. Agents and other tools can read `graph.json`.
You can open `report.html`. codeweb also creates Markdown versions.
[See the description of each output file.](docs/reference.md#outputs-under-targetcodeweb)

## Use it as an MCP tool

`scripts/mcp-server.mjs` is a zero-dependency Model Context Protocol (MCP) stdio server. It gives
MCP clients access to **28 tools**. The tools help the client orient, read the structure,
check before writing, gate an edit, and plan cleanup.

The September 14 packaged assessment
exercised the baseline loop with Codex CLI 0.154.0; it did not certify every tool in every
client. Claude runtime compatibility and other clients were not tested in that assessment.
See [the recorded scope](reports/paperclip-pilot/readiness-01/PACKAGED-ACCEPTANCE.md).

**The plugin registers the server automatically.** To register the standalone server, run:

```
claude mcp add codeweb -- npx -y -p @ghostlygawd/codeweb codeweb-mcp
```

**Requires Codeweb 0.15.0 or later.** Use the installed MCP server, or register a source
checkout using its absolute path as shown in the [reference](docs/reference.md#the-mcp-server-tool-by-tool).

The loop an agent runs:

1. Orient with `codeweb_brief` (or `codeweb_find` when no symbol name is known).
2. **Before editing**, call `codeweb_refresh {baseline:true}` once to capture fresh source.
   Ask `codeweb_explain`, then `codeweb_context`, `codeweb_impact`, or `codeweb_dependents`
   about the symbol before changing it.
3. **After editing**, call `codeweb_diff {before:"baseline",refresh:true}`.
4. If red, repair the code and repeat that same diff against the **same baseline**.
   Do not capture another baseline during repair: `baseline:true` replaces the original.
   Ordinary and automatic refreshes preserve it. Start a new baseline for the next task.

Known unsupported same-line JS/TS declarations produce `status: "inconclusive"` and
`ok:false` instead of a clean gate. Inspect the diagnostic locations and callers in source.
The detector covers known layouts; no diagnostic does not prove complete extraction.

Read `analysis.checks`: a skipped check is not a pass. Refresh drops overlap evidence, so
this loop does not evaluate duplication; structural green does not prove behavioral
correctness. Run the project's tests too. If the baseline is missing, edited source cannot
reconstruct it — recover the pre-edit source before beginning again.

For npm v0.14.0, use the [snapshot quickstart](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/start.html#npm-quickstart).
For the unreleased checkout, try the [tiny cycle → repair → green walkthrough](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/start.html#cycle-walkthrough).
Clients that hide the server's built-in instructions can paste
[the rules snippet](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/start.html#rules-snippet) instead.

The server includes these agent-specific features:

- **Optional `graph` argument:** The server finds the nearest map when you omit `graph`. If no map
  exists, the error directs the agent to `codeweb_map`.
- **Budgeted responses:** Responses include the highest-ranked items and the true totals. A context
  response that was approximately 300 KB is now approximately 10 KB.
- **Staleness information:** A stale result identifies its state and directs the agent to
  `codeweb_refresh` — on the orient tools and on every spawned advisor answer.

[All 28 tools, grouped and explained →](docs/reference.md#the-mcp-server-tool-by-tool)

## How it works

For JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, C, and C++,
codeweb uses a **deterministic Node pipeline** by default. One command creates the map. No LLM is
in the pipeline, and the same input produces the same bytes.

The map pipeline has the four stages in the following diagram. `scripts/run.mjs` also creates
`optimize.md` after overlap analysis and before report rendering.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/brand/pipeline.svg" alt="codeweb's four deterministic stages: extract, cluster, overlap, render" width="100%">
</div>

1. **Extract** (`extract-symbols.mjs`) parses each source file into atomic nodes such as functions,
   classes, and methods. It also records call and import edges. If a bare call can refer to more
   than one definition, codeweb omits the edge instead of guessing. Per-file caching makes
   extraction incremental and byte-identical to a full rebuild. An imported `.json` file enters
   the map as a file-level node without being parsed. An unreferenced `.json` file stays out of the
   map, which prevents lock-file noise.
2. **Cluster** (`cluster3.mjs`) removes genuine utility hubs and groups the remaining nodes into
   directory-anchored semantic domains.
3. **Overlap** (`overlap.mjs`) detects duplicated logic and parallel implementations. It compares
   each candidate with the actual function bodies by using token-shingle similarity. This check
   prevents name coincidences from becoming findings. A structural pass over
   identifier-normalized *skeletons* also finds renamed Type-2 clones
   (`find-similar --structural`).
4. **Render** (`build-report.mjs`) converts `graph.json` into the self-contained `report.html` and
   `report.md` files.

For a language that the extractor cannot parse, codeweb **uses the agent path**.
`codeweb-dissector` agents extract nodes and edges for each subsystem. `codeweb-domain-mapper`
then assigns domains and overlaps.

Both paths produce the same `graph.json` schema. In **external** mode, each path also adds an
adoption verdict.

**Versus a language server (LSP):** an LSP answers one hop on demand — definitions, direct
references — inside an editor session. codeweb builds one deterministic whole-graph artifact:
transitive impact, duplication with body evidence, dead code, and domain coupling.

Agents query that artifact over MCP, and CI diffs it to gate a PR. The two compose — codeweb
replaces the grep loop, not your language server.

Choose a reading path in the [documentation index](docs/README.md), which also explains
repository ownership. [The component map](docs/reference.md#components) details the engine.

## Roadmap

- **Support more first-class languages:** codeweb currently supports thirteen native languages:
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, **Rust**, **Go**, **Java**, **C#**, **Ruby**, **PHP**, **Kotlin**,
  **Swift**, **C**, and **C++**. Other languages use the agent fallback. Dynamic-dispatch AST tiers
  cover JS/TS, Java, C#, Python, Go, Rust, **Ruby**, **PHP**, **C**, and **C++**. Kotlin and Swift
  dispatch requires a trusted wasm grammar at the pinned ABI. See `scripts/grammars/PROVENANCE.md`.

_Recent releases added the agent-intelligence suite (**hotspots**, **campaign**,
**reading-order**, Type-2 clone detection, and suppression memory), a
**[live interactive demo](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/demo/)**, Go and Rust on the fast
path, duplication trend data, and the one-command CI regression gate with a GitHub Action.
codeweb currently provides 28 tools._

## Versioning & releases

The maintenance commands below require a Codeweb source checkout.

codeweb follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). It records changes in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), which uses the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Each capability, benchmark, and fix ships
in a **tagged GitHub release**.

`package.json` is the source of truth for the version.
`scripts/mcp-server.mjs` is the source of truth for the MCP tool count. The release tools derive
and verify the other values:

```bash
npm run version-sync        # propagate version + tool count -> plugin.json, SKILL.md, README badge
npm run check-consistency   # fail if any public-facing surface has drifted
npm run build:site          # regenerate the docs/ website (zero-dependency, deterministic)
npm run release -- --minor  # roll the changelog, bump, sync, rebuild; prints the git/tag steps
```

`check-consistency` runs in CI. It gates version strings on every surface, recognized prose patterns for
the tool and language counts, the CHANGELOG entry for the current version, and every evidence
file the ledger cites.

## About

Built by [GhostlyGawd](https://github.com/GhostlyGawd). AI agents helped write much of the code.
The commit co-author trailers identify those contributions. Open an issue for questions or
problems. Use [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) to report a security issue.

**Stay current:** codeweb does not contact an update service. To receive release notifications,
select **Watch → Custom → Releases** on GitHub.

## Free forever, and where the paid line sits

The rule, ratified in [`CHARTER.md`](CHARTER.md): **anything that runs on one laptop against one
repo is free forever; money buys hosting, multi-repo aggregation, and human attention.**

Everything in this repository is that free half — the map, the MCP tools, the hooks, the report,
the CLI, the self-hosted gate Action, and every language codeweb learns. MIT, no accounts, no
telemetry, no license keys. Nothing here moves behind a payment later.

The planned paid half is a separate hosted service, **codeweb Teams**: the gate run for you, and history
held across every repo in an org. Billing lives only in that service, so a payment problem
degrades the hosted tier and **never breaks** your local tooling or your CI.

Hosted availability is not established by this repository’s local checks. The pricing page
retains the sign-up doorway.

Read the full contract on
[the boundary page](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/boundary.html), and the planned Teams
price on [the pricing page](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/pricing.html).

## Support the project

[Sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/GhostlyGawd) supports the project. Sponsorship also
provides advertising. Top sponsors can put their logo at the top of this README, and each sponsor
can join the supporters list. See the
[support page](https://codeweb-hq.github.io/codeweb/support.html) for details.

## Handoffs

You can send codeweb outputs to `refactor-cleaner`, `codebase-onboarding`, or `code-tour` if you
have those tools. codeweb does not require them.

For a useful next step, apply the highest-ranked **ready** merge from `optimize.md`. Then run
codeweb again and compare the findings count.
